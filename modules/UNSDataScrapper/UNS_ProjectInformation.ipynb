       "[{'description': 'Arnhem Central is a large urban plan development that consists of diverse programmes which together form one vibrant transport hub. This cluster forms one of the main thresholds into Arnhem. To ensure a lively station area throughout the whole day, we incorporated a carefully considered mix of programmes including shops, offices, housing and a cinema complex.\\n\\nUNStudio developed the overall masterplan of the station area as well as the individual components. These include, among others, the transfer hall, train platforms, Park and Rijn Towers, car and bicycle parking, the Willems Tunnel and a bus terminal.\\n\\nThe compact stacking of programmes enabled triple ground use. Passenger flows for six different modes of transport are organised by the central transfer terminal. Here, a large twisting central column enables a day lit, open hall that forms the heart of the station and guides foot, bicycle, car, bus, trolley-bus and train traffic along its way.',\n",

Further up the Cultural Bridge connects the two towers, while also providing an interactive public space. The ’Crown Plaza’ is located at the top of the tower with a hotel and cultural exhibition space. As part of the digital museum of this urban destination, the ‘cultural crown’ is located on the top of the building.

The third floor lobby itself was designed as a triple height space with a transparent glass facade facing Little Collins Street. The transparency and scale of the lobby create visual and physical relief from the otherwise dense urban fabric on Little Collins Street. By contrast, design features along the facade reduce frontal views from the adjacent buildings and provide partial screening and an increased sense of privacy for guests.\\n\\nCorresponding with glazing transparency and reflectivity, this strategy allows for both optimum night time and daylight conditions. Combined, these elements resolve themselves in a composition that deftly negotiates the challenges of their context and turns the 80 Collins precinct into ‘a breathing space’ in the busiest part of Melbourne.',\n",
       "   'Considered Design\\nFollowing a series of collaborative workshops with a third party review, the attributes of the existing 80 Collins scheme were enhanced by the design team to maximise the site’s potential, creating a site specific building that becomes a world class address. The design team also closely engaged with the hotel operator to ensure the programmatic mix and operational considerations of the site had been addressed to present the best design outcome. Cognizant of the calibre of the project, these workshops and collaborations elevated the stature of the project.

Aluminium and glass were selected for their reflective qualities, along with a construction logic that ensures crisp forms. Design features such as vertical cuts bring daylight into the hotel corridors, while at night these cuts are lit - highlighting the location and connections of all public functions within the building. The dark coloration of the frontage also makes the building distinct among the surrounding buildings.\\n\\nTo overcome the context and proximity with neighbouring buildings the hotel facade is designed to make optimal use of daylight, redirect views from within the hotel and offer guests a sense of privacy. The design of the facade on the upper floors considers the introverted nature of the guest rooms by overlaying an articulated skin of solid folding panels with glazed inserts. These features guide guests’ views eastward across the 80 Collins plot and up Little Collins Street, creating ‘introverted hotel rooms’ as opposed to the ‘extrovert amenities’ on the lower floors, which open up their more communal programmes towards the street-scape.']},\n",

It is conceived as a centerpiece that performs as one integrated system and is crafted to reflect the sun, cast graded shadows and changing light throughout the day. The façade is carved out of the silhouette of the tower and works as an integral part of the structural system. The sculpted building is composed of three main elements: the horizontal balcony planes, the curved walls and the clear enclosure.\\n\\nThe balcony design becomes the main identifying aspect of the project, accentuating the voluminous appearance of the building through an interplay between light and shadow. The tower plan is configured in an octagonal symmetrical shape, which assists in reducing exposure to predominant winds. The facade design introduces two contrasting materials; an alternating rhythm of solid curved walls followed by straight glass walls, as well as undulating balconies with a system of wall rotations on every floor that contributes to the dynamic impression of its appearance.',\n",

These stepped terraces also create a unique feature for this residential project, as they can be used for additional amenities for the adjoining apartments.\\n\\nThe development also offers a wide range of apartment types and layouts to address the needs of different residents. Typology division is made in such a way that it minimises the separation of different social groups, while entrances and common spaces are shared by all. \\n\\nIn combination with the possibility to use of the outdoor terraces on the stepped podium, the design for K31 Courtyard encourages residents to enjoy outdoor living throughout the year and to create an open neighbourhood in the sky and a lively new addition to the Moscow skyline.',\n",
       "   'Community-building\\nFor K31 Courtyard the notion of ‘a neighboorhood’ has multiple dimensions. Referencing the old-style Moscow courtyard, which was quiet and private, while also being accessible and safe, the development is designed to extend horizontally and connect to the city. Playgrounds and green recreation spaces in the courtyard are also visually connected to pedestrian routes on the outer perimeter of the block.\\n\\nNeighbourhoods can also develop vertically to promote connections between people who live around the same stairwell by means of shared intermediate amenity spaces. Two dedicated communal areas can also be found on top of the podium at the foot of each tower, which can accommodate co-working spaces, sport facilities and a clubhouse for residents.\\n\\nThe stepping roof terraces create another diagonal neighbourhood, where the roof apartments on the podium can be personalised by adding curated terrace units such as verandas, orangeries or greenhouses.',\n",
       "   'Facade design\\nAn intricate facade variety is achieved by use of a parametric modelled modular system. In a strong grid, we introduce a random combination of modules with windows, bay windows, French balconies and standard loggias, resulting in increased apartment types, with overtly indoor-outdoor variations.\\n\\nTogether with the possible use of the outdoor terraces on the stepped podium, we motivate the new K31 Courtyard residents to be living outside throughout the year and create an open neighborhood in the sky which will be a new hallmark for the Moscow skyline.\\n\\nThree facade types\\n\\nThe podium facade on the outer perimeter uses brick and black metal to resemble the surrounding buildings and preserve the heritage of the location as a former industrial territory.\\nThe two towers that top the podium have panoramic windows and loggias. The light materialisation and colour of the towers is designed to give a less weighty appearance and is especially important when viewed from the courtyard, so that that the volumes of the towers appear to visually dissolve into the sky.\\n\\nThe inner facade of the courtyard employs a similar lightness to the tower volumes, with natural wood creating a strong connection to the green, tree-planted courtyard and a warm and comfortable atmosphere for the residents.']},\n",

With lush green space and a comprehensive sustainability and climate adaptation strategy, inclusivity extends to embrace not only people, but also animal and plant species and the planet.\\n\\nBy also envisioning the new ConfEx Park as the city’s future benchmark for excellence, our design proposes a green landmark, one that will tell the story of resiliency, and will broadcast the environmental performance of this new green space.',\n",
       "   \"A City of Layers\\nFacing the challenge of transforming a huge amount of programme into a human-scale space, our proposal looks at Thessaloniki's DNA, as a city with a rich history, a melting pot of cultures through time, and of layers and gems. This is all visible in the urban fabric, with monuments and fragments of antiquities transforming a stroll around the city into an experience of discovery.\\n\\nOur design embraces this layered structure of the city by adding one more, a layer of nature and ecology. Translated formally into a thick forest with tree canopies, the nature layer forms a green base. At the same time, the new Exhibition, Congress and Business Centre buildings form another kind of base, on top of which sits a canopy of green and publicly accessible roofs, and a series of smaller buildings with a public destination.\",\n",
       "   'Merging Buildings & Forest\\nPodiums and buildings are treated in different ways for ConfEx Park, enhancing the idea of ‘Gems in the Forest’. The design proposal blends the bases of the new buildings with the lower level of the forest, while the buildings appear as distinct volumes on the upper level. In order to achieve this blending into their surroundings, the bases are made of natural materials, while the vertical dimension is explored to synchronise with tree trunks.\\n\\nThree basic materials are used for the facade treatment of the base; first, transparent glass at the places where the building “breathes” and people come in and out, second, corrugated panels, and third, foggy reflective glass that augments the presence of the forest. On top of the base, canopies with curved edges, further blur the big volumes with the green, creating interesting perspectives of the buildings and playful interactions with the trees. Each building has a distinct shape, creating natural wayfinding on the site.\\n\\nA series of smaller destinations and activity areas, such as the TI3F restaurant, playgrounds, exercising areas, meeting areas and walking paths, cater to local residents and visitors, offering the possibility for a unique recreation experience among lush vegetation. The new Forest will grow over time, and thus, the site will change, offering a different experience to the residents of the city. It will become more beautiful over time, becoming a legacy and an investment for future generations to come.',\n",

This does not, however, apply to the south western outskirts of Amsterdam. This area is enclosed between Amsterdamse Bos and Schiphol Airport, which means that it can never really become a standard urban development area. The airport noise and safety risks demarcate boundaries for development and thus ensure the conservation of the area.\\n\\nThis permanent urban periphery therefore offers a unique opportunity to fully exploit it as a ‘frayed edge’. UNStudio’s study proposed a new meandering building/path through the area for people and nature, connecting the city, the landscape and offering new opportunities for the area.',\n",
       "   \"A Diverse City Park\\nThe Amsterdamse Bos currently functions as a peripheral city park. However, to the west of the woods, a fringe is emerging where urban functions and the logistics of the nearby airport merge. Whilst a variety of animals and plants make optimal use of the variation in habitats, people benefit too, as the area houses artists' colonies, a city farm, riding schools, small-scale industry and large-scale recreation facilities. This fringed edge thus offers space for functions that rarely find their place in the city.\",\n",
       "   'An Urban Paradox\\nThe presence of Schiphol Airport gives south-west Amsterdam a unique urban condition. Due to noise and safety risks, this urban periphery cannot develop further into a typical urban environment. Certain functions, such as living, are simply not permitted within the noise radius of the airport. The ‘nuisance’ of Schiphol Airport therefore becomes essential in maintaining the greatest quality of the area: its free space. As a result, UNStudio’s proposal uses the paradox of the nuisance contours to protect and exploit the benefits of this beautiful urban periphery and prevent it from disappearing completely.',\n",
       "   'Drifting Through the City’s Edge\\nIn UNStudio’s HyperEdge vision, the two sides of the city’s edge are connected by a continuous building/path, opening up currently inaccessible areas and functions and enabling local residents to discover and appreciate the value and qualities of the area.\\n\\nThe proposed new building/path demarcates areas on both sides of the city edge that function as zones for recreation, arts, research and experimentation. Specific rules apply here for layout and use, but aside from that, the study leaves the final programming of the area open. In this way, room is created for experimentation and innovation that remains within clear and safe boundaries. The proposed intervention frames a space of free interpretation and creative expression.',\n",
       "   \"Humans at Play\\nThe new building/path through the outskirts of the city is seen as a habitat for 'humans at play', drawing on the ideas proposed in Dutch historian and cultural theorist Johan Huizinga's book Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-Element in Culture. With this in mind, the building/path promotes discovery, design, creativity and innovation. While it supports and links these qualities, it also presents a challenge: the physical construction, on or above the ground, provides starting points for alternative use and the potential of the fringe as a ‘nursery’ for the city.\\nAccessible only to pedestrians, the building/path not only connects the areas on both sides of the urban periphery zone, but it also provides structure to the rich biodiversity in the area, offering protection to existing flora and fauna, while providing new types of habitats to further stimulate the diversity of species in the area.\",\n",
       "   'An Evolving Design\\nResponding to the existing qualities of the city fringe, the HyperEdge building/path is both a grand gesture within the landscape, and a small and subtle intervention. The winding route of the path is designed to link various experiences, such as viewpoints, special bridges, community spaces and gardens.\\n\\nThis structure has no intentional design but is rather a framework waiting to be filled, enabling both people and nature to determine how it evolves. Zigzagging through the frayed edge of the city, the character of the path adapts to its surroundings. The premise of this approach is that we cannot design the outskirts of the city, we can only provide the conditions within which something happens that cannot arise anywhere else.',\n",
       "   'Minimum Intervention, Maximum Effect\\nThe HyperEdge concept enables this fringe area to develop unexpected qualities with economic value for the city. It suggests the creation of experimental conditions and provides a place where artists and makers, among others, can co-create. Everything that is an integral part of the city, but cannot find a place in it, can settle here. With the design vision of the continuous building/path, the required conditions are formed with minimal intervention, while the resulting qualities can have a maximum effect on the economic and recreational value of the area.

Visitors gather at and form the metaphoric ‘Hebrew Language Plaza’, a public space that shares the same purpose with the language itself: connecting people. The plaza (marked orange in the diagram below) is adaptable according to its users, in much the same way as how the language itself differs depending on who is using it.\\n\\nIn UNStudio’s proposal, this metaphor and the plaza form the highlight of the museum experience. The plaza, which is also visible from certain points of the exhibition space and easily accessible from the exits of the museum, is the functional focal point of the complex that connects all three functional areas. The Academy’s main entrance is from Weiz Street, while the main access to the Museum is from the east, via the park. This provides privacy for all sections of the building, while linking them closely to the plaza.\",\n",
       "   \"The Structure\\nIn the written form of Hebrew, the horizontality of the syllables is one of the language's most apparent characteristics. We drew on this for basis of our design for the overall structure of the museum.\\n\\nThe abundant space in the letters seems to soften the strong characters and creates a graphic flow in the written texts. These characteristics are used to shape the building by embracing dominantly horizontal volumes with flowing voids and open space in between. The architectural narratives, reminiscent of written Hebrew, unfold as visitors walk through the curated sequence of exterior and interior spaces.\",\n",
       "   'The Character\\nThe character of the museum was inspired by the cadence of Hebrew. When spoken in daily life, the language tends to sound less gentle, while in religious texts and poetry it is spoken in a softer and more mellow tone. This duality is expressed in the building by creating a strong impression of the Academy for those driving past, or those viewing the building from a distance. For this reason, the volume is robust and dynamic from the outside, while the large ornamental and undulating ceilings of the courtyards and terraces create a comfortable and pleasant interior landscape.\\n\\nThe ceiling, with its sound installations inspired by Hebrew poems, forms an integral part of the museum experience (see image below).',\n",
       "   'Museum Experience\\nThe museum experience begins with a simple but unified expression of the historic notion that through time, the Hebrew language has been revived, after having almost disappeared. The journey to the museum brings the visitors through a tunnel that descends underground before emerging into a central gathering space. From here, visitors then ascend to the museum levels through a vertical circulation space that commemorates the revival of the language.\\n\\nThe tunnel and vertical gesture are both an exaggerated spatial and haptic experience that set the tone for the rest of the exhibition, which focuses on detailed knowledge and the discovery of the Hebrew language.']},\n",

They will then emerge next to a 30 metre tall waterfall, in the centre of this underworld landscape. As they climb and explore the landscape around them, they arrive at the 3rd space: a very public and transparent elevated lobby. In this large lobby they are immersed into the depths of the sea, and through an almost ritual ascension on the main ramp, are then pushed to the surface of the water. In this vertical movement, the visitor is exposed to different exhibits, atmospheres, perspectives of the space and visual connections to the other clusters of the permanent exhibitions, that together create a rich, flexible and interconnected space.\\n\\nThe exhibition programme is designed to be experienced in a fluid way. The different halls and routes expand and cross each other around four main circular areas, offering multiple routes and different ways to experience the collection. Each of these circular areas has a unique character and function. The central area consists of a large ramp around a void that connects all the exhibition floors in a continuous experience. The remaining three are the centres around which the three permanent exhibitions are organised, as they spill into each other and create memorable experiences both as a network of spaces and by themselves.\\n\\nThe Themed exhibition about the Great Bay Area is situated on the rooftop, establishing a direct visual connection between the exhibits and the Bay Area. Through a series of large windows and terraces the explorer can finally rest and take in the beautiful natural surroundings.\\n\\nThe overwater area acts as an extension to the publicly accessible 3rd Space. It is an open and flexible event space catering to both visitors and locals, and is placed on top of a landmark underwater restaurant.',\n",
       "   'Sustainability\\nThe proposal for the building aims to be a landmark in sustainability. Good water practice regarding reduced consumption, closed loop recycling and cleanliness are particularly important considering the ambition of the building to be a national education centre about the sea, and the relation of the museum with the surrounding wetlands.

This creates a continuous envelope that is perceived differently from different viewpoints and at different times of the day, sometimes being fully closed and sometimes subtly revealing part of the interior.\\n\\nThe underside of the upper volume has a characteristic soft shape that relates to the landscape below.

       "  'concepts': ['Design Concept - Urban Park\\nGuangzhou is a wonderful mix of a historical and a modern, forward-looking city. The challenge of designing an OPPO store within this city is to develop a contextual reaction and strategy that respects the qualities of the city, while also representing OPPO’s brand values. With the ambition to create a gathering space that blurs the boundaries between public space and commerce for OPPO’s new and existing customers, UNStudio introduced an ‘Uban Park’ concept. This concept creates an inclusive environment that meets the behavioral needs of the various people who visit the store. The interior is designed as a ‘borderless’ interactive environment, where meandering routes surround a central resting point, thereby creating different rhythms of motion and allowing customers to browse, take their time, pause and try out the products within the store.',\n",
       "   'The Facade – the Modular Tube\\nThe design for the Guangzhou OPPO flagship store is approached through a keen focus on craftsmanship, alongside material choices that add a contemporary twist to the vernacular architecture of the city.\\n\\nA streetside facade design was required that would provide the store with a strong and recognisable visual identity. As a result, a repeated tube form was chosen, inspired by bamboo - an important source of food, clothing, housing, and transportation for people in Guangzhou in ancient times - as the main modular element used in the facade. This metallic tube is also an interpretation of the ‘O’ in OPPO, when it is transformed from 2D into 3D. This dimensional transformation results in a cylindrical tube, into which a cut is added in order to obtain a truncated cylinder. This cylindrical form becomes the main modular element and is repeated throughout the facade, creating a reference to both the brand and to technology.\\n\\nFor the overall composition of the facade elements, multiple geometric strategies were studied. Following the exploration of different volumetric options, a large, sweeping folding gesture was chosen which echoes the corner curve of the OPPO brand logo, while guiding visitors towards the entrance to the store.\\n\\nLighting effects are then added to create an overall effect of dynamism and vibrancy. This results in an optical effect of rhythmic motion across the facade, representing the New OPPO Culture, new technologies and the pulse of OPPO as a company experiencing continuous growth.\\n\\nAt the indoor entrance, located within the mall, a ‘grey space’ space is created between the interior and the atrium. Here the materials used in the interiors and large LED screens extend from inside the store out into the atrium, minimising the store’s boundary.',\n",
       "   'The Interior – Fluid, Continuous Geometry\\nAchieving a fluid space in a flowing, uninterrupted yet dynamic way - where an intuitive sequence of different areas enables customers to experience and interact with the products - was one of the key aims of the interior design.\\n\\nThe interior space is defined by two main areas: PULSE and EVOLUTION. In the PULSE area the main phone displays act as a strong focal point, while the EVOLUTION area, in contrast, enables different experiences and accommodates a café and social zones. Throughout the store charging seats are installed around translucent pillars. Referencing social clusters around trees in a park, these seating elements provide comfortable areas for customers to relax and socialise. The store also provides customers with a playful experience zone, where they are also encouraged to discover the features of the phone’s cameras by taking photos and selfies.\\n\\nNatural colours and fluid forms are applied in the interior. Anodized aluminum plate with a customised surface treatment is used alongside micro and translucent textured partitions, creating the perception of subtly layered changes of depth throughout the interior. Green granite terrazzo flooring is used to create meandering paths through the store, while integrated ‘pathways’ of lighting in the ceiling mimic this fluid flow and frame the different areas and displays from above. These pathways in the floor and ceiling further serve to guide visitors intuitively along various routes as they wander through and around the space.']},\n",

The fins respond to a set of contextual, performative and programmatic parameters, producing a different effect on each side of the building. Through the control of a set of fin variables: length, depth and coloration, the fins acoustically shield the building from interruption from the hustle and bustle of the city. In addition they block the strong summer sun while enabling a diffused light to enter the interior spaces. The irregular distribution of fins breaks down the vertical exterior surface of the Tower, thus interrupting the wind downfall and ensuring the comfort of all the surrounding public spaces.',\n",

Recognising the dynamic environment in which we live, with plenty of economic and social fluctuations, the resilient approach will contribute to a future-proof design for Piraeus Tower.

Multiple training and conditioning techniques help improve a player’s performance. For this reason, the new NFC is home to over a dozen various sporting field typologies, natural running tracks, and indoor gymnasiums.\\n\\nWellness\\nMental health is closely linked to the physical body’s development and nourishment. As a result, the campus not only provides facilities for the players to rest, relax and relieve stress, the material palette is derived from this essential driver. Where possible, local natural materials of raw and exposed stone, timber, and textiles are employed, while an abundance of vegetation and green space is provided, thus embedding the campus into the surrounding landscape of farmland and hills sides.\\n\\nScience and Technology\\nInvesting in the next generation of athletes is key to the success of any sports programme. The NFC will therefore become a laboratory for, not only training the first national team, but also for the training of youth leagues and woman’s teams involved in the sport. This collective gathering of various levels of athletes will provide sports medicine scientists with the wide-ranging data they need to evaluate and custom tailor different training regimens.\\n\\nDigital technology has permeated sports allowing coaches, management and health care services to track the progress and development of sports programs yielding the greatest results from their facilities.

The volumes reflect the changes in the spatial requirements of the interiors and their functions. The facade openings signal changes in function, while connecting the indoor and outdoor environments. Social spaces are clustered in the large gestures of the volumes in order to activate the buildings vertically and create space for interaction. These spaces also introduce a biophilic green environment to the interior.\\n\\nThe indoor environment is inspired by traditional Milanese interiors and uses only circular materials, which support the zero energy target. The interior is designed to be a responsive environment where specific elements are in dialogue with the users. For instance the lighting is controlled by occupancy, but can also be personalised it in the common spaces. The data analysis based monitoring of the spaces makes operations efficient and the user experience bespoke.\\n\\nA hotel is located in the higher tower at the top of the development, thereby fully utilising the potential of the CityLife site. The design of the hotel originates from traditional Milanese courtyards. The lobby is located in a floating garden that expands through the hotel volume, floating above the entire office block and CityLife. Upon arrival, visitors find themselves in a semi-outdoor, green and lush garden. All of the hotel rooms are accessed from this space, which also offers the most spectacular views of Milan.',\n",

The two buildings both apply a vertical social campus concept where workspace is clustered around community, thereby enhancing interaction, creativity and engagement between users. These social gathering spaces - visible in the appearance of the towers - are the heart and soul of the buildings. They are strengthened by their connection to the exterior and with green areas which further blur the boundaries of interior and exterior and increase the performance, motivation and efficiency of the users.\\n\\nThe workspace is designed to serve three main different types of activity, in order to guarantee flexibility of usage. Typical cccupants are freelancers, entrepreneurs, start-ups and small teams that require dynamic, versatile and varied workspaces.  A personalised environment, alongside communication suites includes both individual and group workspaces.\\n\\nFormal office layouts per floor - that are supported by optimal daylight conditions - include small break-out spaces for social interaction. This layout is optimised for focused work where full concentration is required.\\n\\nThe collaborative office levels are designed to foster workplace communities and teamwork. Circulation and workplace zones are arranged to encourage interaction and communication. High flexibility and a diversity of spaces provide the opportunity to attract different users.\\n\\nThe design of creative workspace revolves around the concept of ‘encountering’. As such the CityLife workspaces are designed to inspire; to provide a catalyst for spontaneous interactions and the exchange of ideas.

The three entrances to the project are formed by the hotel lobby at the southern tip of the site, the residential lobby that faces inwards for privacy, and the commercial plaza entrance. There is also a three-level parking area below the commercial plinth which services the residences, the hotel and the public programme.\\n\\nTaking advantage of the existing slope on the site, the podium appears to be partially tucked underground.

The garden accentuates the feeling of spaciousness and connectivity, while providing a varied landscape with activity areas for both the residents and guests.\\n\\nThe garden is the unifying plane of the whole project. With a single gesture, it extends upwards to the towers, creating numerous dedicated garden terraces for the special residences. It signifies the transition from the shared area - with facilities that include two outdoor pools and several pavilions - to the privately owned areas, which enjoy private pools alongside areas of paving and green.\\n\\nThe garden is intended to empower healthy living; the design amplifies active circulation, while providing opportunities for exercise alongside a multitude of green spaces in which residents can live, work and play in local proximity. The large garden is designed as a place for gathering and a space for physical and psychological comfort and stimulation.',\n",
       "   'Sculpted Living\\nThe design of the towers plays a key role in the implementation of sustainability measures, which begin with the massing. Their placement is the result of parametric testing to find an optimal position that would avoid casting shadows on each other and on the garden in the afternoon hours, and minimise any impact on the surrounding neighbourhood. The facade length is also maximised in order to provide all residences with views over the Bosporus waterway.\\n\\nThe form of the towers results in a sculpted, fanning effect. The top floors gradually step inwards at the side with the most prominent views, in order to allow for larger penthouse terraces. The central levels, which form the core of the tower, host most of the residences. Meanwhile, the lower floors, where the fanning is most evident, establish the connection with the garden.\\n\\nThe fanning enables the towers to seamlessly merge with the garden, as the two elements come together to provide a healthy biophilic element that increases the occupants’ connectivity to the natural environment.',\n",
       "   'Villa Living in the Sky\\nTo ensure stunning views on all sides of the site, we introduced a glass facade that wraps around the towers. A horizontal ribbon then winds around each floor and introduces variety to the balustrade design.\\n\\nThe terraces also contribute significantly to the reduction of the heat load on the large glass surfaces of the towers. Aside from the terraces, a continuous French Balcony surrounds the full plan, providing access to all rooms. This means all rooms can also enjoy natural ventilation, while apartments have the opportunity to cross-ventilate, thereby reducing the need for air-conditioning and lowering energy usage.\\n\\nTo accentuate the individuality of each residence, each terrace extends or recesses in relation to the terrace above it. As a result, every resident enjoys a double-height outdoor living space, creating an experience of villa living in the sky of Istanbul.',\n",
       "   'Designing with Craftsmanship\\nThe aim of the facade design for the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and Residences is to employ materials that portray artistry, wherein hand-craftsmanship is evident in the quality of the design and workmanship. Metalwork, pottery, ceramics and woodwork, become the references for the principal materials used in the project.\\n\\nThe anthracite ribbons are clad with glazed ceramic tiles, inspired by centuries of tradition and knowledge, in addition to a multicultural mixture of influences. These tiles are cast in such a way as to catch the light differently across the course of the day.\\n\\nIn addition, bronze details throughout the project give the feeling of both tradition and exclusivity. Such details are employed in the lobby areas and in the ceiling design of the terraces.\\n\\nA sense of place at the commercial entrance is achieved by introducing wooden frame elements. The detailing of the frames not only incorporate the technical requirements for ventilation, but also reflect the honing of the design to achieve a natural and tactile environment.']},\n",

With the given examples, our moderators led the participants in a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of proposing these interventions for certain public areas.',\n",
       "   'The Outcome\\nDuring the workshop, we found that each group honed in on different issues in Meerzicht. One group started off by making distinctions between ‘short term’ and ‘long term’ climate adaptation strategies, and pursued a strategy that coincided more with the long-term vision: creating a New York-style ‘High Line’ of the current NS railway. By burying train tracks underground, the group wagered the elevated green walkway could not only provide a new space for leisure and exercise, but also spur a new sense of belonging in Meerzicht residents.\\n\\nAnother group focused on the health outcomes of their interventions and prioritised the need for high-quality public spaces in the city, proposing piazzas with fountains that would create opportunities for social engagement and meanwhile cool the air through water evaporation. Their proposal stressed the need for communal involvement, particularly advocating for inclusive neighbourhood initiatives.\\n\\nThe third group confers from the perspective of playfulness and adaptability, and places a priority in responding to the question ‘what kind of society do we want to strive for?’ The group considered the approach of adaptability through looking at varying climatic conditions and their relation to nature. They conferred that the introduction of new, leafy trees will support both wind dampening and air-cooling in the spring and summer, whilst their barren state in the autumn and winter means flexible awnings could be considered as an additional measure to offer protection from rain.\\n\\nDespite the tight time constraint, participants were able to come up and successfully deliver ideas that went beyond small-scale intervention to tackle climate issues. Together, the groups developed a long-term vision for Meerzicht, a neighbourhood for today’s residents and tomorrow’s generations.']},\n",

This is achieved by stacking them vertically to create a landscape of different experiences. These experiences will be placed within the building envelope in key positions that are visible from the street, thereby allowing a glimpse of the activities taking place within and blurring the boundaries between the inside and outside space.\\n\\nInside the mall, elements of outdoor street life are mixed with lifestyle retail features and are distributed throughout the building. Resembling a leisurely stroll outside, this organisation encourages the visitor to wander through and explore the different levels of the building, where retail spaces follow an open layout and are punctuated with small kiosks.\\n ',\n",
       "   'Banded inside-out\\nThe cylindrical tower geometry from the north-west corner of the existing building gives rise to the idea of undulating bands that define the building and determine the breakdown of the volume. These bands further create terraces and connect to the plaza and the street level. In the interior, the bands form atria and create a variety of activity spaces. Exterior and interior space are therefore controlled by the bands, which connect programme and activities by seamlessly moving through the facade layer and continuing into the interior.\\n\\nIn addition to this horizontal interconnectivity, several spaces are also connected in a vertical direction. The sunken plaza located towards Huai Hai Road connects the street level to the basement metro entry, while stacked balconies connect the ground level all the way to the roof garden. All platforms, terraces and outdoor spaces are planted with lush vegetation in order to create a new green urban landscape for this vertical city centre concept.',\n",
       "   'Facade\\nMatching the existing stone facade of the building - which will remain on the tower levels - and referencing the Shikumen brick used in Xintiandi, the dominant solid material used in the facade is terracotta. The high quality metallic finish of the terracotta tiles complements the glamourous atmosphere on Huai Hai Road. The use of the latest production techniques also ensures that the tiles form a very strong and durable facade material.',\n",

Here the magnolia - Shanghai’s patron flower – is applied as a recurring motif. At the numerous access points to the mall, this flower motif is integrated into the backlit ceilings and is reimagined for use throughout the building, with columns inspired by the magnolia reaching all the way to the top of the building. These ‘flower columns’ are the central design feature of the mall and provide the visual connection between the different levels and spaces in the interior.\\n\\nTwo voids cut through the building volume and allow for a generous influx of natural daylight and ample views, which open up all the way from the second basement level to the top floor. The main diagonal void includes several plateaus that strengthen the idea of nature and organic structures when seen from below. Viewed from above they reveal flexibly programmable retail spaces.',\n",

       "  'concepts': ['Gateway to Xintiandi\\nIn collaboration with Shui On Land – owners of both the Shui On Plaza and the Xintiandi developments – a strategy was established to turn the Shui On plaza into the gateway to the Xintiandi area, thereby enabling a transition and fusion of the international high-end fashion street Huai Hai Road and the traditional small scale Shikumen architecture lifestyle and F&B area.\\n\\nThe main concept for the Xintiandi Plaza design is to compile and compose these differing local characteristics within one building. This is achieved by stacking them vertically to create a landscape of different experiences. These experiences will be placed within the building envelope in key positions that are visible from the street, thereby allowing a glimpse of the activities taking place within and blurring the boundaries between the inside and outside space.\\n\\nInside the mall, elements of outdoor street life are mixed with lifestyle retail features and are distributed throughout the building. Resembling a leisurely stroll outside, this organisation encourages the visitor to wander through and explore the different levels of the building, where retail spaces follow an open layout and are punctuated with small kiosks.\\n ',\n",
       "   'Banded inside-out\\nThe cylindrical tower geometry from the north-west corner of the existing building gives rise to the idea of undulating bands that define the building and determine the breakdown of the volume. These bands further create terraces and connect to the plaza and the street level. In the interior, the bands form atria and create a variety of activity spaces. Exterior and interior space are therefore controlled by the bands, which connect programme and activities by seamlessly moving through the facade layer and continuing into the interior.\\n\\nIn addition to this horizontal interconnectivity, several spaces are also connected in a vertical direction. The sunken plaza located towards Huai Hai Road connects the street level to the basement metro entry, while stacked balconies connect the ground level all the way to the roof garden. All platforms, terraces and outdoor spaces are planted with lush vegetation in order to create a new green urban landscape for this vertical city centre concept.',\n",
       "   'Facade\\nMatching the existing stone facade of the building - which will remain on the tower levels - and referencing the Shikumen brick used in Xintiandi, the dominant solid material used in the facade is terracotta. The high quality metallic finish of the terracotta tiles complements the glamourous atmosphere on Huai Hai Road. The use of the latest production techniques also ensures that the tiles form a very strong and durable facade material.',\n",
       "   'Interior\\nBringing the outside landscape into the inside of the building creates a natural, organic effect, which is also evident in the interior design. Here the magnolia - Shanghai’s patron flower – is applied as a recurring motif. At the numerous access points to the mall, this flower motif is integrated into the backlit ceilings and is reimagined for use throughout the building, with columns inspired by the magnolia reaching all the way to the top of the building. These ‘flower columns’ are the central design feature of the mall and provide the visual connection between the different levels and spaces in the interior.\\n\\nTwo voids cut through the building volume and allow for a generous influx of natural daylight and ample views, which open up all the way from the second basement level to the top floor. The main diagonal void includes several plateaus that strengthen the idea of nature and organic structures when seen from below. Viewed from above they reveal flexibly programmable retail spaces.',\n",
       "   'The escalator void organises the vertical circulation and orientation. It creates view lines across the different levels and facilitates an unobstructed view column from the ground floor up to the skylight. The spiraling handrail surrounding the void guides the visitor to the next escalator. It further connects the voids and the different visitor routes, while carrying people through the building past a variety of activities and the magnolia columns. Finally, it culminates with the top level garden dining experience and the roof top garden.\\n\\nFrom both inside and out, the experience of Xintiandi Plaza will become a memorable one along Huai Hai road, acting as a stand-alone lifestyle retail experience, as well as the gateway to Xintiandi.']},\n",
       " {'description': 'Will offices still exist in 50 years’ time? UNStudio’s Futures team, together with Swiss furniture brand USM, has designed a theatrical installation to reflect shifting boundaries between work and domesticity, now and in the future.\\n\\nUNStudio’s Futures team was commissioned to explore changes taking place within the world of work, understand how these affect USM and identify opportunities for the future. Way back in 1930, economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that, by the early 21st century, advances in technology would lead to an “age of leisure and abundance” in which people might work 15 hour weeks.\\n\\nWell, it didn’t exactly turn out that way. Work rules our lives today more than ever, and technology allows work to invade our leisure time. As digital nomads we are increasingly mobile, ready to set up office wherever we are. Cafés resemble living rooms, restaurants feel like home kitchens, and co-working spaces have replaced the home office.\\n\\nUSM’s booth marks the beginning of a long-term exploration for the company. UNStudio’s design explodes the spaces in which we live, using the USM modular system as a platform to support an absurd hybrid of domestic and office environments hidden within four floating chambers: the Dining Room, the Bedroom, the Bathroom and the Home Office. Being highly sustainable, the single parts of the booth can be reused for the next project after Milan.\\n\\nOver the past few years, it has become conventional wisdom that automation, along with advances in artificial intelligence, have put us on the path to a jobless future. But all may not be doom and gloom. With the eradication of ‘bad jobs’ we can focus on finding meaning in our working lives. How can we learn more at work? How can we play?\\n\\nA question posed in each room prompts us to reflect on the human qualities which differentiate us from machines and invites visitors to enter a dialogue with USM. Will the future workplace be designed around qualities rather than professions? Will work in the future take place in an office at all? Feedback from visitors will inspire a WorkHouse this summer in Berlin, where we’ll dive deeper into the idea of post-work and the need for lifelong learning to future-proof our careers.',\n",

The accessory is designed to combine sculpted form with functionality; twisting steel evokes the intertwining roots where truffles grow, while the curved profile and 18° angle between emphasises the ergonomics of the grip, reduces pressure on the wrist and distributes weight evenly to produce the perfect slice. An adjustment mechanism allows the user to vary the thickness of the slices from 0 to 3 millimetres, and allows the user to completely close the blade so the utensil can be stored away safely. ‘Alba’ is the two-year end product of the “De Truffle” workshop that was launched in 2015 by Alessi, The National Centre for Truffle Studies and the International White Truffle Fair of Alba. At this workshop, fifteen designers were briefed to develop functional solutions for a utensil that has been used in kitchens for 300 years. From the fifteen designs that were developed over this period, Alessi chose to produce the ‘Alba’ truffle slicer designed by Ben van Berkel/UNStudio, taking account of technical feasibility, aesthetics and poetic force. ‘Alba’ is a functional table top microsculpture that offers a new aesthetic for slicing and serving the rare Alba White Truffle.\\n\\nAlberto Alessi: “Subject to the assessment of the skilled Selection Committee, to the opinion of the public and to their technical feasibility; the one which was chosen is: Alba, designed by the Dutch architect Ben van Berkel who […] had a brilliant insight by bringing the concept back to the primordial typological reference of the item itself: the Plane.”\\n\\nThe prototypes and concepts developed for the “De Truffle” workshop will be exhibited at the “De Truffle.

PROOFF originally approached us with the idea of displaying a large amount of furniture in a limited space, but their greater ambition is to redefine the future of workspaces while pushing the boundaries of furniture design. The concept of a proactive workspace became the key driver and catalyst to our experimentation with virtual reality.\\n\\nAs an architectural practice, while we often utilise high-resolution renderings, diagrams, drawings and/or sketches to represent our ideas and enable clients to connect with our solutions, we often desire to push these methods further. By constantly innovating our representational techniques, we endeavor to captivate the audience and storyline an idea, beyond traditional representation techniques. Because of our recent experience working with PROOFF, we have incorporated VR as an integral representational technique within UNStudio and will continue to explore new ways in which to use it.',\n",
       "   \"Advantages of VR\\nThe advantages of using virtual reality are fast becoming apparent within the architectural design process. Our initial uses of VR were limited to additional presentation techniques in which we could give our clients a more experiential look into the spatial qualities of designs. These were often times seen as additive or 'special features' and were offered to few clients due to the high cost of production. Through our collaboration with PROOFF, we were able to experience a range of applications for VR beyond merely an additional representational technique. Currently we have set up a dedicated VR room within UNStudio for the testing the potential for the use of VR within our practice.\\n\\nVR is not the newest nor most innovative technology. Having been around for over 60 years since the first prototype [1], it has had considerable time to evolve.  So why has it just recently come into the spotlight?  Speculation as to whether VR would become mainstream was confirmed two years ago when Facebook purchased Oculus Rift, connecting the VR technology to 1.65 billion online users [2].  Recently, Sony made another stride towards mainstreaming VR when they announced their PlayStation VR headset, focused on gamers. This announcement revolutionised the market and created an affordable approach to VR, allowing users to utilise virtual reality without the need for expensive PC hardware. The PlayStation VR headset is already being used in 40 million households. VR is no longer just a niche product for a niche marketplace.\",\n",
       "   'What do we do with VR?\\nNow that VR is accessible, what do we do with it? Although VR has been around in theory since the 1950’s, it was not until the 1980’s – before even the advent of the internet – that VR was being researched for practical applications, such as medical uses. Today, possible applications for VR seem endless, with various industries such as the military, fashion and entertainment industries embracing VR for a multitude of reasons. Whether the technology is being used to remotely defuse a bomb, help NASA refit satellite units, or allow users to try on clothing in a virtual catalogue; VR has now entered mainstream consciousness. The cross-platform unifying factor of VR is its user-centric nature. VR allows users to feel more in control and creates a unique relationship between designers and end-users. This user experience is much like the IKEA effect, which describes the cognitive bias in which customers place a superfluous amount of value on products partially made by themselves – as appreciation and self-worth often outweigh the standard pre-made product. The most recent example of this relationship is the VR capable Rio Olympics, hosted by NBC. Together with Samsung, around 30 million viewers per night were able to access the Olympic Games in virtual reality, as long as the viewer owned a Samsung device. This type of usage sets the stage for marketing VR.\\n\\nThe Olympics are a staple in the sporting calendar, familiar to almost everyone worldwide. With VR, Samsung added a unique feature to a familiar experience, creating a more vivid memory for audiences utilising the new technology. VR is still relatively new to the average user. Marketing strategies are currently fixated on the newness of VR today, capitalising on users who are unfamiliar with the technology. However, this type of marketing can create a fleeting feeling and runs the risk that the technology may be considered merely a gimmick. We believe that over time, due to its accessibility and diverse applications, VR will prove to be a relevant tool for all, especially architects.\\n_____________________________________________\\n[1] \"History Of Virtual Reality.\" Virtual Reality Society. 2016.

       "  'concepts': [\"Placemaking\\nAs a public transportation system, an urban cable car should be designed based on layout functionality and efficient, accessible mobility. Beyond that, as a new type of visually distinct public transportation, a cable car system creates opportunities to make new ‘places’ within a city; places that strengthen a city's identity while being fully integrated into the urban fabric and public transport system.\\n\\nThe most visually apparent elements of the Cable Car system are its towers. As highly visible landmarks, they would define a new skyline for the city. It is from this great responsibility that we wanted to move beyond aesthetics and make a true referential bridge between the history of the harbour city and its future. As such, the towers are inspired (and reference) the steady motion of Gothenburg’s famous shipyard cranes. Designed in a way that emulates the dynamism of the cranes, the ever-changing constellation between the towers bring a multi-faceted and unique experience from different vantage points in the city. To create a clearly identifiable and visually continuity across the system, we used a series of design principles based on triangulation, adaptability, materiality, geometrical layering, transparency and nighttime illumination.\\n\\nIllumination was also key in the placemaking strategy, achieved by spotlights that line the inside of the tower beam surface. Light cutting through a gap between structural components creates a thin, sharp line which subtly emphasises the silhouette at night, visible across the city. This strong identity would make them clearly recognisable as destination points within the city, with the highest tower at the Lindholmen quay imagined as a city balcony located on the water: a new urban focal point that makes the water accessible and provides a new destination for social gathering. The stations themselves are not only designed around principles of natural wayfinding and social safety, but also with a strong identity in mind. Although each of the four stations would be unique, they would still be clearly recognisable as part of the same system, and also as destination points within the city.\",\n",
       "   'Urban Integration\\nStations and towers need to adapt and adjust to varying programmatic and urban requirements in a way that meets the cable car operational and functional requirements while also allowing for necessary traffic clearances.\\n\\nThe towers are designed to be as light and transparent as possible, allowing views to the city through them. At the same time, their triangular geometry allows them to adapt and blend seamlessly into the various urban conditions. Their light and open structure avoids casting heavy shadows, while their base facilitating urban paths, streets and green spaces to pass through them, avoiding the creation of dark, socially unsafe conditions. \\n\\nA similar principle applies to the stations, which in their basic geometry, are designed to be adaptable to different urban conditions. Both the station shelters and the main circulation can be easily adjusted in a systematic way, making it possible for them to blend into their surroundings while remaining recognizable as Cable Car stations. At ground floor level, the permeability of the station design allows for an easy overview of both the station and surroundings, and unobstructed flows around and through the station’s structure. The station thus becomes an almost seamless part of the urban landscape.',\n",
       "   \"Efficient Mobility\\nThe design of the four stations along the cable car track create an efficient and accessible form of public transport that does not compromise on safety or natural wayfinding. As such, the basic geometry of the stations go beyond the single objective of adapting to different urban conditions. Public transport, being public by nature, needs to accommodate all types of travellers in an inclusive way. Everyone should be able to easily and comfortably navigate their way through the system. The triangulated wood clad walls and ceilings of the stations bring a warm glow and act as a strong, welcoming signifier. The gesture of the unfolded wood clad walls and ceilings guide passengers up towards the platform, where the 'floating' roof structure frames views of the surrounding city. Within the self-supporting roof structure, large skylights flood the platform with daylight, while all vertical transportation routes are carefully positioned to allow for the shortest routes and different speeds of travel. For the intermediate stations, a conceptual hinging mechanism around the station’s ‘centre point’ enables their main geometry to ‘kink’ in different required directions.\",\n",
       "   'Sustainability\\nA key element of the project is sustainability: environmental, social and economic. The Cable Car as a new type of urban public transportation is fundamentally pursued because of its benefits in terms of environmental impact. Energy use is reduced within the stations through the incorporation of large skylights that flood daylight into the stations and through the use of artificial lighting that uses low energy systems. Furthermore the energy for these systems would be provided by photovoltaic panels which are integrated into the roof surface of all stations. The design and engineering, in particular of the towers, is optimised towards prefabrication. This leads to shorter construction time of the cable car line on site and would therefore greatly minimise environmental impacts.\\nFor the system to be fully sustainable however, it also needs to achieve social and economic sustainability, which can be facilitated by making the stations as accessible, as safe, and as user friendly as possible. This holistic approach to sustainability can be achieved through active and passive strategies that allow us to go beyond being environmentally conscious alone. Non-technological and passive approaches encompass material selection, public programming, accessibility and flexibility. These passive strategies are balanced by active technological approaches that optimise operational efficiency. In addition, the Gothenburg Cable Car system would increase the social value of publicly used buildings along its route, which in turn, would boost its own occupancy and use.']},\n",

Each row of curved loops is then mirrored vertically, creating a stacked display system which connects and twists its way through the bottles – wrapping and embracing fine wines like a ribbon embellishing a gift. Ribbon therefore alludes to and accentuates the anticipation of discovery and of surprise.',\n",

       " {'description': 'During the 2020 World Expo, many visitors will be introduced to Dubai for the first time, from young families to the big names of the future. It’s this first impression of vibrancy and cultural distinction that became our foundational approach to the STAR 2020 project: a mixed-use campus gateway with exhibition space, retail opportunity and a residential master plan.\\nRather than only designing for an enclosed indoor space, a key focus in our approach to the STAR 2020 project was to rethink how Dubai is experienced year round in a mixed in and out-door campus setting. Dubai’s climate must be grappled with when deliberating the year round occupation of exterior spaces, and to overcome this, we managed to leverage many natural and passive sustainable methods within the design to bring greater comfort to visitors. Massing optimization was used to achieve increased shadow coverage, glazing orientation angled to reduce direct incident heat gain, natural climate cooling through pools and vegetation, and indigenous high R-value ceramics as shading louvers and surfaces on facades.\\nCoiling through the site is a dual corridor of retail, forming themed “oasis plazas”. In order to provide thermal protection and improve comfort to visitors during their shopping and leisure experience, we oriented the taller hospitality massing components on their sides on top of the retail blocks, thus utilizing their shading capability over longer portions of the site. The result is a stacking logic that creates countless shopping experiences and paths for discovery, keeping the visitor intrigued each time they visit the campus.',\n",

We were asked to create a series of distinct identities across multiple scales for two residential developments in Daegu Wolbae. The results are provocative, investigative, affordable and health-focused facades and parklands that establish new and healthy lifestyles and break away from the impersonal tradition of high-density living.',\n",

       "  'concepts': ['Apartment Living\\nWhen the Hyundai Development Company asked UNStudio to assist in creating the IPark apartment developments, we opted for a ‘people first’ approach. The residents of this new development now enjoy shared amenities that encourage a sense of community and promote physical and psychological wellbeing. While other buildings leave no option but to return home, residents of the IPark have healthy options: to use the fitness spaces, enjoy the playgrounds with their children, or engage with nature by strolling through the landscaped courtyards and meeting with neighbours.',\n",
       "   \"Textile City\\nDaegu is the fourth largest city in South Korea and is often referred to as ‘Textile City’ - due to its rich history of manufacturing textiles and its annual fashion and textile fairs. By contrast, the repetitive colour and silhouettes of the city’s dominating mega-blocks do not reflect the Daegu identity. In order to capture the essence of this city's vibrant character, two multi-coloured, pixelated motifs - similar in part to the texture of fabric, or a media screen - are used to weave the apartment towers together, whilst creating distinct identities for each development. This use of colour zoning not only reinforces identity, it also establishes community and communicates the relationship between the inside and outside of the two mega-blocks.\",\n",
       "   'Family Friendly High-Rise\\nWhen green space is found next to high-rise neighbourhoods, it immediately becomes a recreational opportunity for local inhabitants, so long as they are close by and easily accessible. While balconies can also bring nature into the living space, they can quickly become cramped, cluttered, underused, or sit uneasily with younger families who live on higher stories.\\nBy placing green parkland at the focal point of the IPark residential blocks, we not only allow for recreation, but encourage a healthy lifestyle and community development for those who live within the blocks themselves. These large open park spaces allow for whole families - who may otherwise not have an opportunity to meet - to gather together in a safe, natural environment. For young families, this space is an opportunity for childhood friendships to develop in the playgrounds, while young adults and teenagers can find a direct link to nature along the running track and gravel forest trails. Such green cores encourage community spirit and can act as a buffer to the social seclusion sometimes found in less considered high rise residential blocks.']},\n",

       " {'description': 'For retail block of the W21-22 plot, the second of our five Baku White City Developments, we designed a self-standing urban actor that is equally rooted in Baku’s cultural identity as it is in the city’s urban fabric. Similar to Baku’s archetypical buildings, such as the Caravanserai or the Bazar, we wanted to show the arch as a persevering architectural leitmotif. Baku’s geographical identity as the City of Wind adds more layers to the concept design of the building. Like a rock that is carved over years by the wind, the volume of the building looks as though it were shaped into a prismatic and reflecting surface: an urban kaleidoscope. With a special ceramic cladding, the materialization of the façade speaks a clear modern language with reference to local archetypes. The development of this façade played a pivotal role in shifting our design thinking, as it was the first building we developed to be covered in a ceramic cladding.\\n\\nThe building site is embedded geographically in the infrastructural network of Baku’s White City, as it sits on one of Baku’s most important traffic routes. The urban flow that connects the historical Old City with the new White City is situated next to the commercial heart of the new development. The retail potential of the ground floor responds to the opportune location of the building within the urban fabric. Anchor retailers can make use of the northern facades that are exposed to the main road that have optimal visibility. The reflective cantilever at Nobel Avenue attracts attention from the pedestrian boulevard along this important traffic artery, and gives the building a defined orientation. The pace of the West side and the South street, which are calmer and more pedestrian friendly, resonant with the western and southern interiors of the block, encouraging a slow window shopping atmosphere.\\n\\nA working landscape of natural daylight and façade ventilation on the top floor of the building create an excellent professional atmosphere on the upper floors, with floor plans that allow for a high level of flexibility. Furthermore, a sustainable heating and cooling system in the form of a soil collector can be located in the building’s base, with boreholes depths of 100 to 200 meters. The collector would fulfill the dual function of heat source in the winter, and heat sink in the summer.',\n",

Our approach to the design of the Hanjie Wanda Square combines both contemporary and traditional design elements in one concept.\\n\\nThe concept of synergy of flows is key to all of the design components; the fluid articulation of the building envelope, the programming of the dynamic façade lighting and its content design and the interior pattern language which guides customers from the central atria to the upper levels and throughout the building via linking corridors. The interior concept is developed around the North and South atria, creating two different, yet integrated atmospheres. Variations in geometry, materials and details define these differing characters. The North atrium is characterized by warm golden and bronze materials reflecting a cultural, traditional identity. In the South atrium silver and grey nuances with reflective textures reflect the city identity and its urban rhythm. Both atria are crowned by skylights with a funnel structure which connect the roof and the ground floor, in addition to integrating the panorama lifts.\\n\\nThe façade design focuses on achieving a dynamic effect reflecting the handcrafted combination of two materials: polished stainless steel and patterned glass. These two materials are crafted into nine differently shaped, but standardized spheres. Their specific positions in relation to each other recreate the effect of movement and reflection in water, or the sensuous folds of silk fabric.',\n",

The variation between opaque and perforated panels creates a controlled openness, depending on program, views and orientation. In the main auditorium the horseshoe form was chosen for its acoustic advantages and the proximity it affords to the stage.',\n",

Relating to the components of the brief provided a framework for the architecture, which correlates the physical transition between these components. Following the borders of the site is the rectangular base, a redbrick plinth which contrasts starkly with the light metallic structure above it. This subdivision coincides with the construction method, concrete for the plinth and steel for the main mass. While this relates the base to the specific features of the location – or rather, the lack of these – the building orchestrates its own origins in the spatial encounters within.',\n",

This project consists mainly of two small service buildings. These technical constructions each have a concrete core, enveloped by an asymmetrical skin of perforated steel plates and titlted roof planes. In conjunction with the general asymmetry this emphasizes the ‘un-architectural’, object-like character of the inaccessible service structures. Rather than real, lived-in buildings, these structures function as urban signposts for the tunnel entrances. These entrances are characterized by the simple application of profiled aluminium cladding. Steel beams are placed crossways over the sober concrete tunnel mouths.',\n",
