		"description": "Arnhem Central is a large urban plan development that consists of diverse programmes which together form one vibrant transport hub. This cluster forms one of the main thresholds into Arnhem. To ensure a lively station area throughout the whole day, we incorporated a carefully considered mix of programmes including shops, offices, housing and a cinema complex.\n\nUNStudio developed the overall masterplan of the station area as well as the individual components. These include, among others, the transfer hall, train platforms, Park and Rijn Towers, car and bicycle parking, the Willems Tunnel and a bus terminal.\n\nThe compact stacking of programmes enabled triple ground use. Passenger flows for six different modes of transport are organised by the central transfer terminal. Here, a large twisting central column enables a day lit, open hall that forms the heart of the station and guides foot, bicycle, car, bus, trolley-bus and train traffic along its way.",

The design proposal maximises connected open public areas in the podium, designed for a diversity of uses. This amenity is ample for the tower above that houses a commercial function of offices. The sense of place established at the podium levels continues sensitively throughout the vertical connection with multiple vistas into the lower tower -continuing the overriding theme of connection. This connection is people to nature, park to tower and people to people. The tower form enhances connections through consideration of views, sunlight, slenderness, verticality and context.\n\nThe concept of 'stepping stones' fractures the scale of the tower; the sculpted, slightly shifting segmentation in the foreground corner makes the volume appear both slim and vertically appropriate in its context. The tower form pivots and is wedged to include terraces, which strengthen this connection with nature and the surrounding waterfront context through privileged views.\n\nThere is also an exploration of social connections through the design of the towers. This connection between people strengthens through formal and informal social spaces with experience-led programming including leisure and social wellness spaces."

This public domain extends further, via voids and gardens, into the tower spaces. The frontage adjacent to henry Deane Plaza and Lee Street Frontage is active and full of retail. This creates life and activity in the project as a whole and invites the public into the activities of the office. In this way, the building becomes a knowledge-sharing mechanism, a technological souq, sharing both within organizations, the public and the city.",

The towers are net zero carbon, with integrated PV panels and passive design as a building block to reduce demand. The design approach to the facade uses analysis to inform the configuration, where a combination of transparency and opacity are used to maximize views, while reducing embodied carbon, cost, and maintenance associated with external shading systems. The outdoor terraces provide a range of social spaces, an urban oasis that frames the surrounding urban views with lush greenery."

The roof encases an interior setting that captures vast views towards the Blue Mountains.

The light is filtered through the skylight through lamella, exploring an architectural concept of a \u2018veil\u2019 that filters the light as it enters the interior. This light is detailed but diffuse to captivate, creating an enduring and unique experience. This refined architectural concept defines a district as elevated, timeless and exclusive.",

			"The Kirchberg Valley Concept\nThe site of Kirchberg Valley is developed around the idea of maximising the public green space. To do so, we kept the footprint of all three buildings to a minimum, which additionally lowers land consumption and local impact while ensuring the provision of a very efficient floor organisation.\n\nThe design invites the public to walk through and experience the site, to use it during their daily routine, and as a place of rest. In order to achieve this, we needed to ensure the site\u2019s permeability. Rather than creating a barrier following the plot boundary, over half of the site, that which is fronting the axis of rue Alcide de Gasperi, is open and accessible to the public. This open space is activated throughout the day with a series of carefully planned programmes that attracts users and ensure the livability of the area.\n\nThe new public space is set to become a lively and healthy environment that will benefit the city. A public space rich in vegetation and dense trees will be accessible to pedestrians and bring a boost of biodiversity and oxygen into the district. This green corridor will connect rue Alcide de Gasperi to the north-west side of the plot through a biodiverse promenade.\n\nAll three main building volumes are centrally located opening the remaining perimeter to the public. The three volumes are specifically spaced in order improve light conditions. Three main plazas are created along the perimeter of the site, defining major accessibility points and acts as a major connector to the entire site.\n\nCourtyards have also been introduced to improve daylight conditions, and are lifted up along the main plazas to create entrances. The two main volumes are designed to extend vertically in order to improve solar exposure. The tower of both main buildings leans gently towards the edge of the site, emphasising the urban corners and the effect of a valley.",
			"The forest as centre and sustainability\nOur design approach differs greatly from the usual urban greening; instead of creating a building and simply adding natural elements around it, we propose to create an autonomous central forest - a green heart of the new development at the plateau de Kirchberg. The buildings will then be integrated into this green, creating a diversity of conditions for the landscape.\n\nInserting densely planted, small-scale ecosystem will be very effective in carbon sequestration as well as have a cooling effect on the surrounding urban context, and offers refuge to variety of animal species. We also encourage planting a large variety of species, which will help regenerate the soil.\n\nOur design also features green roofs that improve the building\u2019s thermal performance, offer green space for leisure, reduce the urban heat island effect, and contribute to CO2 sequestration.\n\nThe ESM and Luxembourg buildings are designed with a holistic sustainability strategy in mind, considering environmental, ecological and sociocultural spheres of sustainability, while also considering process and site-related measures, striving for the highest DGNB rating. The strategy rests on three key pillars: measures for a low-carbon footprint in operation and construction, circularity and flexibility on all of the buildings\u2019 structural and technical systems, and integration of strategies to enhance health and wellbeing of the users.",
			"Office Concept\nAll three buildings of the Kirchberg Valley follow the same underlying design principles and can accommodate the same programme and layouts, be it boxed or open plan offices, or a mix of both. The position of the cores, the construction and the sprinkler system and general distances are resilient and allow for future flexibility.\n\nFlexibility / Long life design\nThe project was designed in a way that allows components to be removed or deconstructed in the future and reconditioned for reuse. At the same time, the floors are made of elements that can be separated, which results in a flexible and resilient building.\n\nEmployee Well-being\nA healthy and inspiring work environment will contribute to the mental well-being of the employees, through stimulating social interaction, prioritising comfort, integrating natural elements and using healthy materials. All of these stimulate healthy behaviours, leading to an increase in productivity and a reduction in sick leave."

			"Floating light images\nThe temporary exhibition includes an immersive interpretation of transformation as analysed in the annual report and is staged using Zumtobel\u2019s lighting technology.\n\nAt UNStudio, we believe in architecture that provides powerful new experiences, which are derived from conceptual models and theoretical ideas. As such, integrated systems where the experience, geometry and functionality of the building merge and become fully synthesised are developed.\n\nOur design for the exhibition Transform is a spatial interpretation of such system thinking. Here, the mathematical Fibonacci sequence, which is frequently observed in natural forms and phenomena, is used to enable an immersive \u2018mindscape\u2019 and layering of images; a variety of altering visual connections that allude to both the creative process and the underlying DNA that can be found in our work.\n\nColoured light and different gradients are used to frame the images that are applied to an ultralight, translucent fabric to give the viewer an immersive experience. The light frames, which float in the space, are offset from one another, while their translucency allows the colours of the individual images to mix. Depending on the combination of colour and gradient lighting, graphics and text appear or disappear, creating varying scenarios that give the viewer the feeling of being immersed in UNStudio's design processes.

			"Office renovation\nIn UNStudio\u2019s design, a building extension along the railway, with offices on the upper floors, public spaces on the ground floor and a green roof extends the existing CFL headquarters. Red awnings, inspired by the roof of the existing building, unify the two volumes and function as a connecting thread.\nA green interior courtyard, reserved for pedestrians, makes a physical link between the Place de la Gare and the Rue du Chemin de Fer, whilst becoming a new main entrance hall for employees. Meanwhile, the station square remains open to the public, and a third employee-only access is located in rue de Fort Neipperg. Employee cars are parked in the underground car park equipped with a car lift.\nThe main volume of the extension descends in stages, expressing the interior configuration in the fa\u00e7ade. This movement highlights the vertical characteristics of the existing building, and maintains its character as the central point in the development.\n\nWhile the space on the roof of the old building made space for solar panels, the roof of the new volume is more accessible, and has the potential to provide building users with a moment to relax; it offers the opportunity to take a break during the day, meet colleagues for a coffee, a place to sit and enjoy the breeze. Green roofs, as well as the interior and exterior courtyards offer different types of relaxation areas for employees and visitors.",

The new extension provides year-round thermal comfort for the occupants, while movable louvers built into the cavity prevent the facade from overheating in the summer.\n\nThey also increase the insulation values and allow daylight deep into the interior, which contributes to the optimisation of energy consumption and the improvement of the overall interior climate and its acoustic performance.",
			"Sustainability\nUNStudio\u2019s design proposal uses an integrated sustainable approach, taking into account the well-being of users and the environment, both in construction and in operation. For this, we designed a building \u2018metabolism\u2019, in which all essential resources are demonstrated to work towards an optimised building concept. The advantage of this approach is the synergy between the different functions, allowing for reduced costs, flexibility, higher performance and efficient operations in the long term. Critical performance gains from this approach include significantly improved user well-being and environment, resulting in reduced sick days and increased productivity. Furthermore, it guarantees resilience for future changes in work and organisation and its long-term investment value."

			"In our design, the Super Headquarter Base would become the urban gateway to Shenzhen. It is an example for the future city, combining new models of working with cutting-edge innovation and improving local quality of life. Tower C would become the icon of the city, the global headquarters where leaders in technology and emerging businesses could come together; a place where innovation would thrive and progress be stimulated. Our design sets the example for healthier, adaptive future workspaces.\nBen van Berkel, UNStudio's Founder and Principal Architect",
			"Synergy Hub\n'Synergy Hub' is the key concept of UNStudio's design proposal for the building. Programmatically, different types of commercial and public functions are placed strategically throughout the building, engaging visitors and organizing activity flows to create a truly vertically-integrated design. The different prograes act in a symbiotic manner, supporting each other's operation and functionality and maximizing interaction between different user groups. \n\nThe 'social spine' is the main design feature of the building. It forms the diagonal gesture that runs up each side of the tower, leading up from the base, where the Central Green Axis and the future Urban Spine intersect. As a key piece of the design, it comprises atria, networking spaces and other shared facilities for both tenants and visitors.",
			"Our goal for the Tower C design is to create a social hub that vertically integrates work, culture and commercial functions as one mixed-use programme, while promoting new healthy and highly performative ways of working. It is a centre-oriented design that benefits from its innovation and creates an icon for Shenzhen.\nHannes Pfau, Partner and Senior Architect, UNStudio",
			"Tower Iterations\nA tailored tool was developed to analyze the different positions of tower C in the urban context. It helps to calculate the proximity of neighbouring towers, the amount of unobstructed views, the skyline, and to study the view of tower C compared with surrounding towers A and B.\n\nThe design team carried out multiple possible iterations before finally finding the position with the best view, best skyline and the least energy consumption for tower C. At the same time, the central green axis, the future city ridge, and the public transit-oriented development (TOD) intersect with each other in \u2018TOD Plaza\u2019, supporting each other harmoniously.",
			"Multi-Plazas\nIn order to create a dynamic vertically integrated tower, multiple public plazas are incorporated along the tower from below to above. On the basement level, the \u2018TOD Plaza\u2019 serves as a gateway to both the site and the surroundings, and acts as a central social hub, providing visitors and the general public direct access to City Hall, the Conference Centre, and the cultural programme, as well as to the two office tower lobbies. Further up the Cultural Bridge connects the two towers, while also providing an interactive public space. The \u2019Crown Plaza\u2019 is located at the top of the tower with a hotel and cultural exhibition space. As part of the digital museum of this urban destination, the \u2018cultural crown\u2019 is located on the top of the building. It is an open art centre, decorated with digital lighting, to become a shining artistic lighthouse above the city. ",
			"Zero carbon design - Healthy, future oriented working space\nUNStudio\u2019s office design of tower C is zero carbon and centered on designing for health. A healthy working space is created which benefits all employees. As much public space and meeting activity space as possible is created to maximize knowledge sharing and collaboration, while the office space is flexible to meet the ever-changing needs of the future workplace.\n\nActive design and renewable systems were applied in the design process. This approach does not focus purely on technical applications, but also uses natural ventilation, shading and daylighting, green roofs and wastewater recycling systems, in addition to a high-performance waterside and HVAC system, which not only improves energy efficiency, but can also reduce operation and maintenance costs. The design proposal for Tower C was a future model for Shenzhen, which integrates an intelligent building system that helps resource integration and risk control. "

			"Flexible Experience\nFor the hotel building, the restaurant, bar, pool, gym and other recreational amenities, which allow for a lively or relaxing experience, are arranged with spaces of varying heights on top of the lobby. The third floor lobby itself was designed as a triple height space with a transparent glass facade facing Little Collins Street. The transparency and scale of the lobby create visual and physical relief from the otherwise dense urban fabric on Little Collins Street. By contrast, design features along the facade reduce frontal views from the adjacent buildings and provide partial screening and an increased sense of privacy for guests.\n\nCorresponding with glazing transparency and reflectivity, this strategy allows for both optimum night time and daylight conditions. Combined, these elements resolve themselves in a composition that deftly negotiates the challenges of their context and turns the 80 Collins precinct into \u2018a breathing space\u2019 in the busiest part of Melbourne.",
			"Considered Design\nFollowing a series of collaborative workshops with a third party review, the attributes of the existing 80 Collins scheme were enhanced by the design team to maximise the site\u2019s potential, creating a site specific building that becomes a world class address. The design team also closely engaged with the hotel operator to ensure the programmatic mix and operational considerations of the site had been addressed to present the best design outcome. Cognizant of the calibre of the project, these workshops and collaborations elevated the stature of the project. The massing is at once private and intimate, and open and generous - amounting to a proposal that will become an important contribution to Melbourne\u2019s urban life.",
			"Hotel Facade\nVarious degrees of exposure and reflection are also applied to the design and materialisation of the hotel facade. Aluminium and glass were selected for their reflective qualities, along with a construction logic that ensures crisp forms. Design features such as vertical cuts bring daylight into the hotel corridors, while at night these cuts are lit - highlighting the location and connections of all public functions within the building. The dark coloration of the frontage also makes the building distinct among the surrounding buildings.\n\nTo overcome the context and proximity with neighbouring buildings the hotel facade is designed to make optimal use of daylight, redirect views from within the hotel and offer guests a sense of privacy. The design of the facade on the upper floors considers the introverted nature of the guest rooms by overlaying an articulated skin of solid folding panels with glazed inserts. These features guide guests\u2019 views eastward across the 80 Collins plot and up Little Collins Street, creating \u2018introverted hotel rooms\u2019 as opposed to the \u2018extrovert amenities\u2019 on the lower floors, which open up their more communal programmes towards the street-scape."

Rather than \u2018oneliner solutions\u2019, we believe that inner city developments require a very contextual approach that adds value to the city for all the people.\nBen van Berkel, UNStudio's Founder and Principal Architect",
			"A site infused with history\nThe Palas Residential site is located centrally, next to the Palace of Culture and numerous other churches and monuments, in one of the most culturally and historically \u2018charged\u2019 locations in Iasi. The site is located at a crossroads between the lower part of the area that is populated by small-scale residential buildings (St. Andrew\u2019s  neighbourhood) and the higher part, which is replete with grand monuments.\n\nThis historic environment, in addition to Iasi\u2019s exciting momentum in terms of economic, academic and cultural development, creates the perfect backdrop for this ambitious project.",
			"The Palas Residential concept\nBuilding the \u2018Horizon\u2019\n\nThe key drivers for the design of the Palas Residential were the integration of the new development into the city and the building of a new community that will blend into the existing social framework of the area. The main spatial gesture used to achieve this, called the \u2018horizon\u2019, is the addition of a level in the building that promotes this integration both spatially and programmatically.\n\nThe horizon is designed as a physical extension of the public space, thus bringing the city into the building and potentially offering a place for the city\u2019s creative professionals.\n\nThis massing concept is driven by the topography of the site and by the different characteristics of the areas above and below the development. This contextual response forms the main gesture and concept for the articulation of the building in terms of both geometry and materials, as well as programme. As such, each part of the building has its own unique design, character, and programme.",
			"Framing History\nPalas Residential generates its identity from its historical location, which will also become the building's new backdrop and provide newly framed viewing perspectives.\n\nMultiple portals are designed to frame the views to the surrounding monuments. Here, brick frames create a strong connection to the city and offer a unique identity to Palas Residential. While crossing the courtyard, residents and visitors are offered a unique perception of the city.\n\nAs such, Palas Residential becomes an active addition to the city, adding to how it is experienced in a discreet way.",
			"Our vision is to create a space that bridges time. Palas Residential is intended to be a contemporary environment that can host quality residential spaces and public facilities, while being fully integrated into the context of the surroundings; an environment that generates its identity based on its historical framework, simultaneously becoming the new backdrop for the surrounding monuments and offering new angles and visibility perspectives for them.\nBen van Berkel, UNStudio's Founder and Principal Architect",
			"Creating a new urban community and a healthy, sustainable and biophilic experience\nAbove all, Palas Residential will be inclusive. As such, a new type of cultural and flexible space is proposed as part of this bridging: a space that will create the place for a contemporary urban public.\n\nA human-centric approach also forms the basis of the design for Palas Residential. Energy management, circularity and well-being are the primary drivers in the choice of building methods and materiality. The careful curation of green spaces with a biophilic approach is crucial for the formation of an environment that promotes health and well-being"

Rather than recycling leftover products, the concept is to repurpose them by combining, overwriting and altering the products in such a way that their original properties are respected. As a result, design inspired by heritage is translated into objects that enhance both the aesthetic and ethical values of the leftover products and the original heritage inspiration.",

			"Another take on creativity, design and creating sustainable values\nFuture Perfect repurposes outdated products without recycling them by translating circular economy principles into methodologies and language of design. The design language draws inspiration from the heritage of textile and fashion patterns, prints and prototype collections of F.FRI (Fashion Research Italy Foundation).\n\nInstead of using virgin materials, Future Perfect starts at the end of the manufacturing process of two project partners \u2013 Object Carpet and Kvadrat. Their waste stream and outdated leftovers, the by-products of an imperfect manufacturing process are looked at as a resource.\n\nInspired by this intriguing archive, the Future Perfect initiative was created by combining patterns from the archive with outdated products left over from manufacturing. The collections and objects designed in the next phases of the project will be created under the umbrella of Future Perfect and all share the same design principles, they can be realised in multiple forms: from new interior products, objects, furniture and fixtures, to visual merchandising campaigns or urban furniture, depending on the products that are reused.",
			"A circular approach\nBased on the historic fashion prints, the outdated textile and carpets, collections are brought to a new life with a circular approach minimising reproduction, recycling and concentrating on creating value by design.\n\nThe new collections created under the umbrella of Future Perfect will not be tied together by formal characteristics, but by the same design principles focused on a unique sustainable approach.\n   "

			"Crafting a centerpiece\nThe Marina Residential Tower finds its form through a precise focus on details. It is conceived as a centerpiece that performs as one integrated system and is crafted to reflect the sun, cast graded shadows and changing light throughout the day. The fa\u00e7ade is carved out of the silhouette of the tower and works as an integral part of the structural system. The sculpted building is composed of three main elements: the horizontal balcony planes, the curved walls and the clear enclosure.\n\nThe balcony design becomes the main identifying aspect of the project, accentuating the voluminous appearance of the building through an interplay between light and shadow. The tower plan is configured in an octagonal symmetrical shape, which assists in reducing exposure to predominant winds. The facade design introduces two contrasting materials; an alternating rhythm of solid curved walls followed by straight glass walls, as well as undulating balconies with a system of wall rotations on every floor that contributes to the dynamic impression of its appearance.",
			"Constructing as a craftsman\nThe Marina Tower is conceived through a contemporary (re)interpretation of local craftsmanship. UNStudio used parametric digital tools to compose and sculpt the building. The selection of warm and earthy materials for the proposal highlights UNStudio\u2019s tactile approach to the senses, diffuses the Attica light and brings a human scale to the space.\n\nThe slender podium sits inside a lush Mediterranean landscape and allows the tower to softly land on the ground. It is the nodal point where the welcoming areas and the social spaces for the tenants are located.\n\nThe landscape concept \u2018Living in a Garden\u2019 aims to deliver a real sense of place and a memorable experience through the utilisation of textures, materiality, colours and aromas. As such, the building creates distinctive gardens each with a unique theme; from subtropical gardens suited to the Mediterranean climate to dry gardens reminiscent of a forest."

			"The very varied apartment mix, with the addition of the cost-controlled housing, will not only enable the social integration of different demographics, it will also provide much needed housing as the city continues to densify.\nBen van Berkel, UNStudio's Founder and Principal Architect",
			"Sound insulation\nOne side of the Belsenpark tower faces a busy elevated road junction. Despite being a source of high level noise pollution, all of the apartments in the tower have an outdoor area. The apartments on the side facing the street have loggias which are enclosed by sound-reducing baffle panes. The surrounding noise is further reduced both by a ventilation gap in the baffle pane and by sound-absorbing wooden.\n\nThe geometric alignment of the deep soffits in the facade elements also offer a high level of soundproofing and passive sun protection, while maximising the view of the Rhine floodplains.\n\nDue to the comparatively low noise levels on the side facing the park, open balconies with all-glass balustrades provide unobstructed views.",
			"Landscape planning\nBelsenpark is strategically located in one of Dusseldorf\u2019s east-west green corridors. The location of the project therefore forms a critical green link within this network, supporting new bio-diversity on a larger scale, while physically connecting various smaller green facilities at a neighborhood level.\n\nThe geometric patterns of the building facades are reflected in the landscape plan, creating seating niches along the main development and emphasising the entrances. At the intersection of the two cycle and pedestrian paths, a water feature creates an attractive place to enjoy the sun, while supporting a sustainable approach to water management.\n\nAdditionally, the integrated rainwater approach combines green components with sustainable water management tools to create a green-blue system that can buffer rainwater.\n\nRainwater is captured on the green roofs via a water retention layer, while the overflow is directed to the planting in the pocket park. This location can also be used as a detention basin during extreme flooding, providing a strategy for a circular water system",
			"Sustainability\nParticular attention is paid to sustainability in the proposal for this mixed-use design. In addition to using prefabricated components in construction and taking a modular approach to the supporting structure, facade and building services, the aim is to significantly reduce CO2 emissions during operations.\n\nModular planning simplifies the process, while focus is placed on resourcing when choosing the construction approach and materials for the design."

		"description": "UNStudio\u2019s proposal envisions an active, diverse and lively urban centre for the new Ellinikon Quarters. This area not only introduces the Ellinikon masterplan as an Entrance District, it works as a nodal point for the wider area. The impact of this node extends beyond the boundaries of the masterplan, towards the adjacent municipalities and the city of Athens, fostering the idea of a \u201820-minute city\u2019. With the aim of becoming an important community, mobility and logistical hub, this masterplan becomes a centre for new urban life in the Greek capital.\n\nUNStudio keenly identified that an \u2018anywhere culture\u2019 emerged following the COVID-19 pandemic. For our proposal for Ellinikon Quarters, we set about planning for resilience, tailoring a new sense of seamlessness by adapting the built environment and bringing in technology to improve quality of life.\n\nThe new Ellinikon Quarters allows for hybrid services to pop-up and occupy the mall, bringing forth a variety of experiences for visitors to the shopping district. Ellinikon Quarters has the capacity to pioneer as a service and logistical hub, becoming an important player for the entire area by capitalising on its size and infrastructural power. Aspiring to a car-free future, the strategic position of the project means that Ellinikon Quarters can become a significant mobility hub for the area. It can offer the possibility to transition from one transport modality to the other, from the metro to tram to micro-mobility modalities such as shared bicycles, Ebikes, electric scooters, and whatever the future may bring.",

Community refers to our placemaking goal where users interact and have interconnected experiences daily. Innovation sees the introduction of creative entrepreneurship, making room for culture, arts and new industries on the site. With a range of active, learning and productive experiences, the pillar of Nature sets out to bring users closer to the environment. The pillar of Economics refers to an investment in adaptability and flexibility in order to meet the needs of the next generation.",
			"How it all comes together\nThe new Ellinikon Quarters come together through a careful curation of diverse experiences, all with the shared goal of ensuring a highly visited, active and diverse centre that is safe and comfortable for all. Arriving at HQ, visitors immediately enter welcome plazas, where they are immersed into the surrounding ambience, including pop-up events or artist-brand curated events.\n\nEach of the four plazas differently addresses its surroundings. As such, the Metro Plaza across from Leoforos Vouliagmenis acts as an entrance to the project and becomes the perfect place for a pop-up crafts and food market to attract curious passersby.\n\nAdditionally, the Tram Plaza, in a more surrounded setting, caters to events where people informally flow along the amphitheatric steps. Through the curation of free and commercial events, a diverse audience can be attracted to the site.\nPromenade\nThe main connector throughout the project is the promenade that orchestrates the users\u2019 experience of the space. The promenade facilitates orientation and operates as the primary distributor throughout the site, connecting the Elliniko Metro with the pedestrian axis of the masterplan. It is anchored by popular stores and large units, as well as by the food hall, which operates across the Tram Plaza\u2019s event space.\nQuarters\nUNStudio\u2019s proposal intends to create a lively, active and diverse centre for Athens, as well a scalable prototype development for retail. Organised in Quarters, the development setting synthesises the following distinct identities:\nHQ1 re-imagines the way we live and work, towards a balanced well-being,\nHQ2 re-thinks the way we shop within a lively neighborhood environment,\nHQ3 re-defines the way we entertain, towards a resilient approach to leisure,\nHQ+ re-connects the community and becomes the physical and digital platform that binds everything together.\nCourtyards\nAlong the promenade, users can explore two main courtyards, the HQ\u2019s \u2018hidden highlights\u2019. To the right of the promenade, going towards the Saronic Gulf, visitors find the Well-being Courtyard, which can be used for yoga sessions, health-focused eateries and related events. Further down the promenade and to the left, the passerby can meander through the Leisure Courtyard with its outdoor eating, performance and event space."

Instead, the new building introduces brightly lit space with a range of white tones and geometric lines.\n\nThe exterior duality of the building\u2019s surroundings are reflected in the interior organisation through an interlocking sectional concept for the functions. This logic, combined with visual coherence in materials and geometry, creates a unique interior experience that is visually linked to the exterior street level, while the roof floods the central atrium space with daylight.\n\nThe interior facade of the atrium is punctuated by exposed capsule-like meeting rooms that can serve as either \u2018working zones\u2019 or \u2018resting zones\u2019. These capsules further enable visual interaction throughout the atrium and towards the office floors. On ground level, the atrium space hosts a hidden garden and functions as a \u2018living room\u2019 to welcome visitors.",
			"Urban Speaker\nThe protective shell of the building manifests as a new \u2018urban speaker\u2019. It is designed to be more reminiscent of a product than a building; one in which every design feature has a performative function.\n\nFully glazed areas are located towards the park and the central zone on this side of the building is equipped with balconies. These enable outside spaces for the users during work-breaks, while also providing sun shading for the levels below. BIPV solar cells are also integrated in the south-facing facade and on the roof.\n\nSemi-glazed zones are allocated in the transition towards the fully opaque facade. In some of these solid areas, especially those located towards the housing area, dynamic lines are used to highlight certain zones, while a perforation pattern and alternation of aluminium panels and glass provide a glimpse of the functions and activities inside the building.\n\nDuring the day, the \u2018urban speaker\u2019 is designed to provide the best possible working environment for its employees from the inside out, whilst at night this workplace begins to glow and become an identifiable part of the city\u2019s skyline."

These stepped terraces also create a unique feature for this residential project, as they can be used for additional amenities for the adjoining apartments.\n\nThe development also offers a wide range of apartment types and layouts to address the needs of different residents. Typology division is made in such a way that it minimises the separation of different social groups, while entrances and common spaces are shared by all. \n\nIn combination with the possibility to use of the outdoor terraces on the stepped podium, the design for K31 Courtyard encourages residents to enjoy outdoor living throughout the year and to create an open neighbourhood in the sky and a lively new addition to the Moscow skyline.",
			"Community-building\nFor K31 Courtyard the notion of \u2018a neighboorhood\u2019 has multiple dimensions. Referencing the old-style Moscow courtyard, which was quiet and private, while also being accessible and safe, the development is designed to extend horizontally and connect to the city. Playgrounds and green recreation spaces in the courtyard are also visually connected to pedestrian routes on the outer perimeter of the block.\n\nNeighbourhoods can also develop vertically to promote connections between people who live around the same stairwell by means of shared intermediate amenity spaces. Two dedicated communal areas can also be found on top of the podium at the foot of each tower, which can accommodate co-working spaces, sport facilities and a clubhouse for residents.\n\nThe stepping roof terraces create another diagonal neighbourhood, where the roof apartments on the podium can be personalised by adding curated terrace units such as verandas, orangeries or greenhouses.",
			"Facade design\nAn intricate facade variety is achieved by use of a parametric modelled modular system. In a strong grid, we introduce a random combination of modules with windows, bay windows, French balconies and standard loggias, resulting in increased apartment types, with overtly indoor-outdoor variations.\n\nTogether with the possible use of the outdoor terraces on the stepped podium, we motivate the new K31 Courtyard residents to be living outside throughout the year and create an open neighborhood in the sky which will be a new hallmark for the Moscow skyline.\n\nThree facade types\n\nThe podium facade on the outer perimeter uses brick and black metal to resemble the surrounding buildings and preserve the heritage of the location as a former industrial territory.\nThe two towers that top the podium have panoramic windows and loggias. The light materialisation and colour of the towers is designed to give a less weighty appearance and is especially important when viewed from the courtyard, so that that the volumes of the towers appear to visually dissolve into the sky.\n\nThe inner facade of the courtyard employs a similar lightness to the tower volumes, with natural wood creating a strong connection to the green, tree-planted courtyard and a warm and comfortable atmosphere for the residents."

			"Innovation to the Power of 3: Intelligent, Inclusive, Iconic\nAspiring to make TI3F one of the most important destinations in Europe and the world for expo tourism, efficiency, functionality and optimisation are the main parameters of our design for ConfEx Park. Our proposal investigates the possibilities to enhance the relationship of the new expo centre with the rest of the city by minimising the impact of large spaces and servicing.\n\nWith a multiple range of diverse spaces that offer full public accessibility as well as flexibility and human engagement, our design is not only able to give back to the community, but also give back to the environment. With lush green space and a comprehensive sustainability and climate adaptation strategy, inclusivity extends to embrace not only people, but also animal and plant species and the planet.\n\nBy also envisioning the new ConfEx Park as the city\u2019s future benchmark for excellence, our design proposes a green landmark, one that will tell the story of resiliency, and will broadcast the environmental performance of this new green space.",
			"A City of Layers\nFacing the challenge of transforming a huge amount of programme into a human-scale space, our proposal looks at Thessaloniki's DNA, as a city with a rich history, a melting pot of cultures through time, and of layers and gems. This is all visible in the urban fabric, with monuments and fragments of antiquities transforming a stroll around the city into an experience of discovery.\n\nOur design embraces this layered structure of the city by adding one more, a layer of nature and ecology. Translated formally into a thick forest with tree canopies, the nature layer forms a green base. At the same time, the new Exhibition, Congress and Business Centre buildings form another kind of base, on top of which sits a canopy of green and publicly accessible roofs, and a series of smaller buildings with a public destination.",
			"Merging Buildings & Forest\nPodiums and buildings are treated in different ways for ConfEx Park, enhancing the idea of \u2018Gems in the Forest\u2019. The design proposal blends the bases of the new buildings with the lower level of the forest, while the buildings appear as distinct volumes on the upper level. In order to achieve this blending into their surroundings, the bases are made of natural materials, while the vertical dimension is explored to synchronise with tree trunks.\n\nThree basic materials are used for the facade treatment of the base; first, transparent glass at the places where the building \u201cbreathes\u201d and people come in and out, second, corrugated panels, and third, foggy reflective glass that augments the presence of the forest. On top of the base, canopies with curved edges, further blur the big volumes with the green, creating interesting perspectives of the buildings and playful interactions with the trees. Each building has a distinct shape, creating natural wayfinding on the site.\n\nA series of smaller destinations and activity areas, such as the TI3F restaurant, playgrounds, exercising areas, meeting areas and walking paths, cater to local residents and visitors, offering the possibility for a unique recreation experience among lush vegetation. The new Forest will grow over time, and thus, the site will change, offering a different experience to the residents of the city. It will become more beautiful over time, becoming a legacy and an investment for future generations to come.",
			"Sustainability as a Service to the City\nThe redevelopment of the ConfexPark region within Thessaloniki provides a prime opportunity to improve the sustainable performance with the revised design. Not only of the site itself, but also of the surrounding neighbourhoods and the city as a whole, without harming the historical building structure.\n\nIt is for this reason that the strategy towards a holistic and systemic approach is built upon three pillars; The Landscape, The Community, and the Buildings. Each of these pillars is again subdivided into different service subcategories helping the city manage urban flooding and drought events, reduce thermal stress in the urban fabric and serving as an urban retreat."

			"Time to Act\nThe dark-coloured, heat-retaining materials used to construct the buildings in our cities are one of the main causes of The Urban Heat Island Effect, as well as the lack of green spaces and exhaust from air-conditioning which also contributes to the effect. Buildings absorb solar radiation and store heat from the sun, which means they not only require large amounts of energy to cool, but that the absorbed heat is also released back into the surrounding urban environment. As a result of this effect, greater energy is required to cool their interiors, while more heat is released and trapped in the urban environment. As global warming exacerbates this problem, there is a pressing need to manage extreme heat in our cities.\n\nBy 2050, 68% of the world\u2019s population are projected to live in cities - an increase of 2.5 billion people compared with today. Most of our cities are not prepared for these developments. For UNStudio, our agenda has never been clearer. As cities across the globe face urgent challenges linked to rising temperatures and growing populations, architects, urban planners and designers must act with urgency. Innovative urban initiatives must be saught out and cultivated in order to sustain liveable, future-proof cities across the globe."

In addition to being a well-known holiday destination, Sochi is famous for hosting the Winter Olympics in 2014, meaning that it also enjoys a considerable network of connections and existing infrastructure.\n\nSochi is also a historical seaport that is home to the most famous concert hall in the south of Russia, a museum of art, the Winter & Summer Theatre, and numerous other cultural venues. A goal of the masterplan is to integrate and activate these venues within the new development, in order to create a familiar yet strong and unified identity.\n\nUNStudio\u2019s waterfront masterplan proposal rebrands Sochi as a vibrant and inclusive mixed-use programme that focuses on hospitality, business and culture while benefiting from the grand cultural legacy of the existing context of the city.\n\nThe goal of the city\u2019s future development is to make Sochi the most progressive and international harbour for culture, technology, health, and innovation and to enrich the life of a local community and visitors.",
			"Inclusive Approach\nDesign goals of the intervention are linked to the creation of a community that will rejuvenate the population and ensures the life cycle of different micro-neighbourhoods. Purposeful green areas will interconnect various smart green ecosystems, which have different lifestyles, while the presence of cultural, design, and innovative districts will encourage health, wellbeing, creativity, and tech innovation.\n\nOne of the parameters to create a successful 21st-century district is to ensure inclusivity and accessibility for an ever-changing society. In order to achieve this, the proposal follows three important concepts:\n\nYear Round Destination: providing a well-balanced combination of principally flexible programme components ensures that 24-hour activity and winter-summer transitions are always organic, versatile, and engaging. Our goal is to create tendencies and platforms for various businesses and entrepreneurs to experiment with long or short-term projects.\n\nNurture-Nature: create a built environment that promotes a healthy lifestyle and public space that foster positive emotions by enhancing our connection to the environment.\n\nInclusive Neighborhood: integrates nature with human living, different demographics, and social groups.",
			"Five Key Design Concepts\nThe design concept for the masterplan follows five key interventions:\n\nExtension: This will include a beach area and a new marina. Called Marina City, it will be a business and innovation centre for either business or leisure travelers with international standard conference facilities, high-end hotels, vibrant nightlife, a globally recognised Design and Innovation Museum and a Yacht club.\n\nMagnets and anchors: At opposite ends of the beach, two very different attractors are established. At the north end, a relaxed and open Festival Village will be located, close to the city centre. This is for local activities, community use, and casual gathering.\n\nAt the other end of the beach is the Marina City, which is a completely new urban quarter with business and innovation functions and a focus on nightlife.\n\nIntensity increase: In between the two anchors, three, themed districts emerge from design principles and attractions: SoCo Playgrounds, SoCo Arts & Culture, and SoCo Healthy Lifestyle. Each district is defined by a different character, urban fabric, green environment, and functional mix, with various services and potential target groups.\n\nCatch a wave: three different routes (The Lanes, The Boardwalk and The Green Wave), each with its own distinct character, will connect either end of the waterfront.\n\nThe Lanes is lined with shops, restaurants, and bars and sheltered from the waterfront. The Boardwalk, on the other hand, is lined with palm trees, beach bars, and bathing spots. Weaving in between these two routes is The Green Wave, a meandering bio-diverse corridor and nature walk that interconnects all layers of activity.\n\nThe \u2018Pops\u2019: at key intersections along the \u2018cultural spine\u2019 that runs along the waterfront, each of the three routes (The Lanes, The Boardwalk and The Green Wave) is punctuated by \u2018Pops\u2019; attractions and destinations such as concert halls, pop-up galleries, a local market, botanical gardens, university outposts, satellite cultural institutions, open-air cinemas, etc.",
			"Technology and Sustainability\nTechnology forms an integrated part of the design that can set up short and long terms targets, execute, monitor and enhance a built and green environment.\n\nTogether, pockets form a network of healthy green spaces with real-time data on outdoor environmental health. This data creates new ways for residents, patients, and visitors to interact with each other and the green environment.\n\nMore fully, the proposed master plan aims to define new targets for the city of Sochi as part of an overarching metropolitan and European health strategy.\n\nThe sustainable environmental strategy should be part of any new city development, thus, carbon neutrality targets, biodiversity, urban climate resilience, and life quality are base targets that the proposal aims to achieve."

			"The Central Plaza\nThe primary vertical circulation between the two main levels expresses itself as the Central Plaza, where we bring the city right into the core of the Hub, with priority given to passenger experience. This is the main hall for departure and arrival, crosslinking all the different modes of transport \u2013 plane, train, metro, APM, bus, car, bike and autonomous vehicles.\n\nAt the same time, the Central Plaza is like a marketplace: where people meet, shop, relax, eat, drink and explore the spirit of Shenzhen. This programming, and the extension of the hub into the development designed on the plots to the north and south of the Hub, also makes it a destination within the Greater Bay Area.",
			"Green and Light as Wayfinding Guides\nAs part of our human-centric approach, we have made light and green into key natural guides. Vegetation leads passengers up to the gates and daylight guides passengers up from the platform level, to the common ground and outwards to the north, the south, and to the east.\n\nBecause our design opens the front of the building to the city, we are able to create fluent connections between the internal and external spaces, with the landscape brought inside, introducing green zones as elements for wayfinding and linking Shenzhen seamlessly with its new front door."

		"description": "The Elysion Congress Centre will be a new state-of-the-art congress and conference centre in the Dutch city of Eindhoven. Serving as a highly visible building, it will enhance Eindhoven's international positioning as an inspiring region of technology, design and knowledge, where Brainport Eindhoven represents one of the leading innovative technology regions in Europe.\n\nTo form the Elysion Consortium that will build, finance and operate a congress and conference centre on an international level, UNStudio and DVP (Diepenhorst de Vos and Partners) joined forces with Van der Valk as client/operator and Huybrechts Relou as contractor (see full consortium list below). Together with Van der Valk's design team and additional specialists, the consortium's ambition is to expand the existing multifunctional space to a total area of 4,000m2 and add a new 1,500 capacity flexible auditorium with a vertical foyer housing breakout spaces and catering areas.\n\nSpecifically, the consortium proposed extending the current Van der Valk Congress and Event location, which also houses hotel and restaurant facilities and is located at the border of a large parkland area that enjoys excellent connections to both Eindhoven Airport and the city centre. By so doing, the proposal facilitates the renovation and expansion of existing facilities, thereby limiting its impact on both the city centre and the environment.\n\nOur proposal for the Elysion Congress Centre has been structured around five architectural interventions. Explore them in detail below.",

			"High Impact Landmark\nThe challenge for the city to create a landmark building, alongside the challenge for Van der Valk to maintain operations during the construction process, resulted in a unique design solution in which the extension of the congress centre is placed next to the existing building, while the auditorium is placed on top of the conference centre building.\n\nThis large cantilevered auditorium structure makes it possible to keep the existing hotel and conference centre fully operational during construction, while creating a clearly identifiable building with access to green parkland, excellent connections and space for logistics.",
			"A Connecting Vertical Foyer\nWith its wooden staircases and vertical green gardens, the foyer functions as the main connector from the ground floor through the different levels of the building. This vertical foyer also houses multiple areas for relaxing, working and informal meeting for visitors. In addition, the foyer connects the entrances to the congress and conference areas, with multiple bars and access to outside spaces. It also functions as the connector for all the facilities and main logistics.",
			"Green Surroundings, Sustainable Approach\nThe ECC is located at the border of the \u2018Genneper Parken\u2019, a large green space between the ring road (Brainport Avenue), the high-tech campus and the city centre. The integration of the project into the Genneper Parken is visible on multiple levels. The park landscape flows onto the roof and under the elevated building. Visitors can relax on the roof or in the shade under the building and enjoy a healthy juice or a coffee before moving on. The Genneper Parken also houses large sport facilities, and as such acts as a driver for physical, mental and social health.\n\nIn the Elysion proposal, a part of the existing hotel building will also be demolished to strengthen the ecology of the adjoining \u2018beekdal Tongelreep\u2019 - an important waterway and brook valley with high scenic, ecological and cultural-historical value.\n\nThe facade of the congress centre is principally made from wood and glass. The ambition is to couple this with nitrogen dioxide absorbing surfaces - an innovative new nano-technology that can capture pollutants from its surroundings.\n\nThe new buildings will also be energy positive, generating more energy than they consume. By using innovative bromide flow batteries, energy can be stored for use during peak times. In addition, the location houses the largest regional charging station for electrical cars. The green ambition for the project is also expressed in the application for a BREEAM Outstanding rating for the design.",
			"A New Mobility Hub for Brainport\nThe expansion of the congress facilities also necessitates an extension in the number of hotel rooms, parking spaces and leisure facilities. To accommodate this, the intention is to create a second hotel tower that manifests sport and leisure, while the parking area is a green extension, placed alongside Brainport Avenue.\n\nBy creating a sustainable mobility hub - with the existing park and ride and the new parking facilities - the location can not only become one of the main charging stations for electrical cars, it can also offer green alternatives for travel to Eindhoven city centre, such as the HOV connection, bicycles and other means of smart transportation.",
			"A Flexible Solution\nIn order to ensure financial feasibility during exploitation, a proposal was developed to create a flexible and hybrid design for the 1,500-seat auditorium.\n\nBy creating different configurations within the conference space, the auditorium can be divided into four independent smaller auditoria, enabling smaller conferences to take place simultaneously within the building. When configured in this way, retractable seating also makes it possible for the lower auditorium to be used as a banquet hall while the other conference rooms are in use. In addition, a recording studio located in the conference centre will make it possible to host hybrid online and live events.\n\nThe main structure of the auditorium is built from a combination of wood and steel, while a large window provides visitors to the auditorium with a spectacular view to the skyline of Eindhoven.\n\nThe new congress centre has become part of the region-deal Brainport Eindhoven, within which 7 million euro has been made available towards its realisation. The ambition is for this new facility to be completed in 2025."

The campus has been designed in full detail, including JetBrains\u2019 specific approach to work culture, which led to custom made healthy work stations for all 1,000 newly housed employees.\n\nIn addition to providing efficient and flexible workspace for the organisation, the campus will create a sense of belonging for its occupants - not just those in the industry, but also to the community and to the city of St. Petersburg.\n\n\u201cJetBrains is a highly innovative company. This meant that we were able to bring everything that we have learnt from designing contemporary work campuses to this design and could create a warm, green, transparent, open and inviting office that stimulates total interaction.\u201d\nBen van Berkel, UNStudio\u2019s Founder and Principal Architect",
			"The Central Atrium\nCentral to the design is the large, vertically stepped, indoor atrium. This generous open space, which connects to an outdoor courtyard and terraces, simultaneously provides clear and expansive views of the Gulf of Finland.\n\nThe atrium forms the core of the new JetBrains community, as it creates the conditions for physical, mental, social and environmental health. This large open space provides a contrast to the office floors, which are based on team and individual focus, rather than an open plan approach.\n\nCentral meeting rooms, breakout spaces, auditoriums and the central restaurant are all organised along the stepped atrium. Bridges span the large open spaces, while carefully designed and intertwined biophilia forms the natural backdrop for all activities.\n\nOver the years, UNStudio has built up an extensive portfolio of office buildings and workspace designs. This has provided us with a deep understanding of what is required of the optimal work environment and the positive impact such spaces can have on the health, wellbeing, creativity - and therefore productivity - of those using them. Within the design of such spaces, both physical vitality and psychological wellbeing are understood to be synonymous, while the creation of community is considered fundamental to the encouragement of communication, interaction, knowledge exchange and creativity.",
			"Year-Round Garden Space\nActing as a vestibule, the imposing lobby creates the first views towards the atrium, while providing cloakroom facilities, showers and spaces for exercise.\n\nThe courtyard on the podium level provides an intimate outdoor overflow space that is embraced by an active gallery connected to the existing office buildings. In UNStudio\u2019s proposal the galleries are used as an orangery / winter garden for outdoor plants, which can then be placed outdoors in the Summer months.\n\nThe energy building, which was located next to the existing offices, is wholly integrated into the new campus building, while the podium level is fully landscaped to provide a place to take walking breaks, in or outside of office hours.",
			"A Sustainable Facade\nThe facade design embraces a sustainable approach, blocking heat gain while providing ample daylight. For the large atrium, a highly transparent, zigzagged facade was chosen, at times spanning the height of three floors.\n\nIn addition to a soft, acoustic shading device on the inside of the glazed skin, cantilevers shade the facade. The lower and upper volumes use a rational grid facade, composed of unitised elements. Protruding glazed ceramic elements provide shading, reflect light, and create a tactility and reflection that will play with the constantly changing light of the skies over Saint Petersburg and the Gulf of Finland."

Not only does it provide multiple spaces for indoor performances, but it brings the theatre of the opera to an urban level. By dispersing various functions across the site, we created a fluid landscape of public performance.\"\n\nBen van Berkel, Founder and Principal Architect, UNStudio",
			"Combining Culture and Nature\nAs the most important project among the 10 new cultural landmarks planned to be built by the city over the next three years, the Shenzhen Opera House occupies a unique position along the coastline of Shenzhen Bay.\n\nOur proposal for the site centres on creating a variety of unique and varied public spaces that bring nature and culture into people\u2019s lives.\n\nAs part of this, we strategically placed public and semi-public areas across the different levels and zones of the project, ensuring the entirety of the site will be active throughout the day and that the public can have a variety of unique experiences across it.",
			"Catering to Diverse Users\nCombining music, words and drama, opera has a unique and powerful way of storytelling. With this in mind, we designed the foyers, plazas and other social spaces of the new opera house with a focus on bringing people together, promoting social activity, and connecting visitor\u2019s journeys and stories. To do this, we centred our design around five main user groups: families, theatre visitors, performers and general staff, outdoor recreation users, and commercial users. For each one, we considered their journey to and through the site, designing the opera house to provide for their needs and individual experiences.\n\nAnother important aspect of our proposal lies in its commercial logic, with cafes, dining and shopping experiences carefully positioned throughout the site. Each commercial zone, whether inbetween theatre halls or around the building\u2019s exterior, allows for a variety of commercial uses, from small dining and pop-up shops to waterfront destination dining experiences.",
			"An Animated Skyline\nThe new Opera House seeks to harmonise with the surrounding natural landscape of the site, drawing from the strong lines of the mountain ridge and the flowing waters of the bay.\n\nAs users move around the building, it provides a continuously animated skyline. The building roof rises and falls like the peaks of the mountains and waves. Every angle is specially designed to give a unique identity to the buildings on the site, and to showcase each theatre individually while ensuring they remain connected as an ensemble.\n\nThe skyline combined with the natural beauty of the site provides a unique branding identity. Whether through visual media or in commercial branding, the building\u2019s relationship to the mountains and the sea becomes the defining feature of the Shenzhen Opera House."

			"Creating a Permanent City Edge\nThe fringes of cities are continiously fluctuating, as they respond to needs for expansion. This does not, however, apply to the south western outskirts of Amsterdam. This area is enclosed between Amsterdamse Bos and Schiphol Airport, which means that it can never really become a standard urban development area. The airport noise and safety risks demarcate boundaries for development and thus ensure the conservation of the area.\n\nThis permanent urban periphery therefore offers a unique opportunity to fully exploit it as a \u2018frayed edge\u2019. UNStudio\u2019s study proposed a new meandering building/path through the area for people and nature, connecting the city, the landscape and offering new opportunities for the area.",
			"A Diverse City Park\nThe Amsterdamse Bos currently functions as a peripheral city park. However, to the west of the woods, a fringe is emerging where urban functions and the logistics of the nearby airport merge. Whilst a variety of animals and plants make optimal use of the variation in habitats, people benefit too, as the area houses artists' colonies, a city farm, riding schools, small-scale industry and large-scale recreation facilities. This fringed edge thus offers space for functions that rarely find their place in the city.",
			"An Urban Paradox\nThe presence of Schiphol Airport gives south-west Amsterdam a unique urban condition. Due to noise and safety risks, this urban periphery cannot develop further into a typical urban environment. Certain functions, such as living, are simply not permitted within the noise radius of the airport. The \u2018nuisance\u2019 of Schiphol Airport therefore becomes essential in maintaining the greatest quality of the area: its free space. As a result, UNStudio\u2019s proposal uses the paradox of the nuisance contours to protect and exploit the benefits of this beautiful urban periphery and prevent it from disappearing completely.",
			"Drifting Through the City\u2019s Edge\nIn UNStudio\u2019s HyperEdge vision, the two sides of the city\u2019s edge are connected by a continuous building/path, opening up currently inaccessible areas and functions and enabling local residents to discover and appreciate the value and qualities of the area.\n\nThe proposed new building/path demarcates areas on both sides of the city edge that function as zones for recreation, arts, research and experimentation. Specific rules apply here for layout and use, but aside from that, the study leaves the final programming of the area open. In this way, room is created for experimentation and innovation that remains within clear and safe boundaries. The proposed intervention frames a space of free interpretation and creative expression.",
			"Humans at Play\nThe new building/path through the outskirts of the city is seen as a habitat for 'humans at play', drawing on the ideas proposed in Dutch historian and cultural theorist Johan Huizinga's book Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-Element in Culture. With this in mind, the building/path promotes discovery, design, creativity and innovation. While it supports and links these qualities, it also presents a challenge: the physical construction, on or above the ground, provides starting points for alternative use and the potential of the fringe as a \u2018nursery\u2019 for the city.\nAccessible only to pedestrians, the building/path not only connects the areas on both sides of the urban periphery zone, but it also provides structure to the rich biodiversity in the area, offering protection to existing flora and fauna, while providing new types of habitats to further stimulate the diversity of species in the area.",
			"An Evolving Design\nResponding to the existing qualities of the city fringe, the HyperEdge building/path is both a grand gesture within the landscape, and a small and subtle intervention. The winding route of the path is designed to link various experiences, such as viewpoints, special bridges, community spaces and gardens.\n\nThis structure has no intentional design but is rather a framework waiting to be filled, enabling both people and nature to determine how it evolves. Zigzagging through the frayed edge of the city, the character of the path adapts to its surroundings. The premise of this approach is that we cannot design the outskirts of the city, we can only provide the conditions within which something happens that cannot arise anywhere else.",
			"Minimum Intervention, Maximum Effect\nThe HyperEdge concept enables this fringe area to develop unexpected qualities with economic value for the city. It suggests the creation of experimental conditions and provides a place where artists and makers, among others, can co-create. Everything that is an integral part of the city, but cannot find a place in it, can settle here. With the design vision of the continuous building/path, the required conditions are formed with minimal intervention, while the resulting qualities can have a maximum effect on the economic and recreational value of the area. The aim is to determine as little as possible, but above all, make things possible."

Visitors gather at and form the metaphoric \u2018Hebrew Language Plaza\u2019, a public space that shares the same purpose with the language itself: connecting people. The plaza (marked orange in the diagram below) is adaptable according to its users, in much the same way as how the language itself differs depending on who is using it.\n\nIn UNStudio\u2019s proposal, this metaphor and the plaza form the highlight of the museum experience. The plaza, which is also visible from certain points of the exhibition space and easily accessible from the exits of the museum, is the functional focal point of the complex that connects all three functional areas. The Academy\u2019s main entrance is from Weiz Street, while the main access to the Museum is from the east, via the park.

These characteristics are used to shape the building by embracing dominantly horizontal volumes with flowing voids and open space in between. The architectural narratives, reminiscent of written Hebrew, unfold as visitors walk through the curated sequence of exterior and interior spaces.",
			"The Character\nThe character of the museum was inspired by the cadence of Hebrew. When spoken in daily life, the language tends to sound less gentle, while in religious texts and poetry it is spoken in a softer and more mellow tone. This duality is expressed in the building by creating a strong impression of the Academy for those driving past, or those viewing the building from a distance. For this reason, the volume is robust and dynamic from the outside, while the large ornamental and undulating ceilings of the courtyards and terraces create a comfortable and pleasant interior landscape.\n\nThe ceiling, with its sound installations inspired by Hebrew poems, forms an integral part of the museum experience (see image below).",
			"Museum Experience\nThe museum experience begins with a simple but unified expression of the historic notion that through time, the Hebrew language has been revived, after having almost disappeared. The journey to the museum brings the visitors through a tunnel that descends underground before emerging into a central gathering space. From here, visitors then ascend to the museum levels through a vertical circulation space that commemorates the revival of the language.\n\nThe tunnel and vertical gesture are both an exaggerated spatial and haptic experience that set the tone for the rest of the exhibition, which focuses on detailed knowledge and the discovery of the Hebrew language."

			"Architectural Build-up\nThe museum volume is raised above the natural wet landscape for which it is developed, establishing a strong contrast between the landscape underneath and the floating volume. The in-between space becomes a cultural playground - the so-called 3rd space. The exhibition areas are organised in the upper volume around four thematic vortexes. The two main vortexes provide different flexible connections between the exhibition floors. The landscaped roof integrates the museum with its surroundings, providing a breakout space for visitors after exploring the exhibition areas, while its playfulness provides the perfect platform from which to enjoy the views of the natural landscape of the bay and nearby hills.",
			"The Exhibition Space\nBased on the ocean\u2019s currents the exhibition flow is designed to be experienced as a slow journey of discovery. The main stream brings you on a long journey through the different permanent collections, from the origins of the oceans to the most modern maritime technologies. At the same time multiple possibilities for alternative routes allow for a tailor-made visitor experience varying in speed and duration.\n\nThe exhibition spaces are designed to create rich moments and immersive experiences, making it possible to observe different exhibits from multiple viewpoints from different floors, thereby discovering familiar objects from unconventional perspectives.",
			"Access and Logistics\nThe pedestrian connection with the surrounding landscape is emphasized, keeping the north and east sides of the plot clean of any drop off points or logistics. The main drop-off is located to the west, while the grand access is located on the north-west corner, gathering both people from the drop off and from the parks. A secondary entrance is foreseen in the south-west corner, serving people coming from the Transport hub. The south facade is dedicated to serving all the logistics with the loading bay, bus parking and parking entrance. The employee and researchers entrance is placed on the south-east corner.",
			"Circulation and Programme Build-up\nThe circulation to and through the museum is a carefully curated journey that offers different choices of experience. Visitors will first submerge and move under water where they will experience the light softly filtering though the water layer. They will then emerge next to a 30 metre tall waterfall, in the centre of this underworld landscape. As they climb and explore the landscape around them, they arrive at the 3rd space: a very public and transparent elevated lobby. In this large lobby they are immersed into the depths of the sea, and through an almost ritual ascension on the main ramp, are then pushed to the surface of the water. In this vertical movement, the visitor is exposed to different exhibits, atmospheres, perspectives of the space and visual connections to the other clusters of the permanent exhibitions, that together create a rich, flexible and interconnected space.\n\nThe exhibition programme is designed to be experienced in a fluid way. The different halls and routes expand and cross each other around four main circular areas, offering multiple routes and different ways to experience the collection. Each of these circular areas has a unique character and function. The central area consists of a large ramp around a void that connects all the exhibition floors in a continuous experience. The remaining three are the centres around which the three permanent exhibitions are organised, as they spill into each other and create memorable experiences both as a network of spaces and by themselves.\n\nThe Themed exhibition about the Great Bay Area is situated on the rooftop, establishing a direct visual connection between the exhibits and the Bay Area. Through a series of large windows and terraces the explorer can finally rest and take in the beautiful natural surroundings.\n\nThe overwater area acts as an extension to the publicly accessible 3rd Space. It is an open and flexible event space catering to both visitors and locals, and is placed on top of a landmark underwater restaurant.",
			"Sustainability\nThe proposal for the building aims to be a landmark in sustainability. Good water practice regarding reduced consumption, closed loop recycling and cleanliness are particularly important considering the ambition of the building to be a national education centre about the sea, and the relation of the museum with the surrounding wetlands. The waterfall and water layer of the 3rd space help cool down the warm air and create a yearlong comfortable microclimate. Grey waters are cleaned in natural biological filters in the wetland areas, before being returned to nature or being used for irrigation of the surrounding parks.",
			"Craftsmanship\nThe envelope of the building is inspired by the local traditional ceramic roof tiles. Local artisans and materials would be employed in developing a contemporary interpretation of the traditional tiles. These tiles would form a breathable protective skin with differing degrees of transparency. Glass transparent tiles are interlocked to enable more open interior spaces in strategic areas. This creates a continuous envelope that is perceived differently from different viewpoints and at different times of the day, sometimes being fully closed and sometimes subtly revealing part of the interior.\n\nThe underside of the upper volume has a characteristic soft shape that relates to the landscape below. Inspired by shipbuilding, the soffit consists of high glossy hardwood planks that create ever changing water reflections from below."

Now is the time to prepare our streets for new types of mobility and uses, and to enable people and nature to reclaim our city streets.\n\nUNStudio\u2019s proposal maps current changes in urban mobility and proposes a paradigm shift in relation to the parameters and design of streets of the future.\n\nOur prototype look at Distelweg (Distel-way), a primary street in the north of Amsterdam, connecting a new ferry terminal and the rest of the \u2018Noord\u2019 area.

			"Innovation System Design\nDesigning the street of the future requires a clear approach to innovation. Innovation however, moves in various stages and at different speeds.\n\nIn order to create a flexible framework, we started by defining the pillars of change that the streets of the future should be designed by. We considered time as a design factor that allows for gradual transition from analogue to digital street components. Lastly, we imagined how nature and new materials would transform the appearance of streets as we know them, and turn them into places of social interaction and experience.\n\nStreet design is akin to system design \u2013 it requires key components that can interact with one another, and together create a functioning and unique organisation of materials, processes, and, in our case, space. The key components focus on our sustainable, social and resilient promise to our communities and to our planet.",
			"Street of the Future Design Toolkit\nWe believe that only if we provide a healthy environment for people and nature, create socially and physically safe spaces, and invite new technology in relation to mobility into our streets, can we create an adaptable framework where the community is invited to design its own place and embed its own sense of identity.",
			"Healthy Environment\nA healthy environment is an essential part of any future street design and can manifest itself in tech installations, a generous amount of green space, electric vehicle parking spaces with charging stations, air purification filters, and regulated traffic, in combination with a reduced amount of car lanes.",
			"Future-proof Mobility\nStreets should be designed in such a way that they can adapt and re-adapt to accommodate the changing needs of users as technologies evolve. This may include the widening of bikes lanes, reducing the width of car lanes in order to accommodate self-driving vehicles and the widening of sidewalks and green space.",
			"Social & Physical Safety\nSocial and physical safety can be achieved through physical landscape design elements in the streetscape, good visibility, commercial facilities on the ground level and street furniture. In order to enforce speed control proper signage and changing of the width of roads must be introduced.",
			"Adaptability\nDesigning a street is not a short-term process. Streets continue to evolve as the needs of their users change. Streets should be able to adapt to changing mobility innovations, a growing need for greenery and changing commercial facilities.\n\nOur design scenarios are based on millstones in technological development:\n\n2020 \u2013 the current state of the street\n\n2022 \u2013 Temporary transition that allows for an immediate upgrade of environmental and safety conditions of the site. Reduced speed and temporary/movable planters will indicate priority to pedestrians.\n\n2030 \u2013 Enhancing the street with permanent landscape elements and additional public use. Shared surface and re-deign of the road slows traffic and allows for children and families to use the road as an extension of the public space.\n\n2040 \u2013 Private mobility is replaced by shared autonomous pods that responds to pedestrian movement. Interactive technology is embedded in the street surface, while new building technology is introduce into the urban scape.\n\nDistelweg in the future is a lively, safe, inclusive space for people and for nature.\n "

UNStudio was asked to redesign the 606 m2 customer experience interior space, alongside a completely new 300 m2 facade.\n\nDesigning a technology flagship store requires a very specific approach, as the design has to reflect the philosophy of the brand, while remaining appropriate to the company\u2019s existing design aesthetic and ethos. In this instance, it was therefore essential to create a total brand experience for the customers that was highly tailored to OPPO. The aim was to create a design that would become an integral and recognisable part of OPPO\u2019s overall branding and a valued experience that OPPO\u2019s customers will want to engage with and return to.\n\nFor OPPO customers, existing and new, the newly designed Guangzhou Super Flagship Store provides a venue where they can familiarise themselves with - and get excited about \u2013 OPPO\u2019s products. For OPPO as a brand, the store represents the \u2018face\u2019 of the company in Guangzhou; a visual brand identity that goes beyond the products and a mere physical point of contact with their customer base.\n\nUNStudio was also invited to carry over the same design DNA to the prominent new Wangfujing Avenue OPPO store in Beijing.",

			"Design Concept - Urban Park\nGuangzhou is a wonderful mix of a historical and a modern, forward-looking city. The challenge of designing an OPPO store within this city is to develop a contextual reaction and strategy that respects the qualities of the city, while also representing OPPO\u2019s brand values. With the ambition to create a gathering space that blurs the boundaries between public space and commerce for OPPO\u2019s new and existing customers, UNStudio introduced an \u2018Uban Park\u2019 concept. This concept creates an inclusive environment that meets the behavioral needs of the various people who visit the store. The interior is designed as a \u2018borderless\u2019 interactive environment, where meandering routes surround a central resting point, thereby creating different rhythms of motion and allowing customers to browse, take their time, pause and try out the products within the store.",
			"The Facade \u2013 the Modular Tube\nThe design for the Guangzhou OPPO flagship store is approached through a keen focus on craftsmanship, alongside material choices that add a contemporary twist to the vernacular architecture of the city.\n\nA streetside facade design was required that would provide the store with a strong and recognisable visual identity. As a result, a repeated tube form was chosen, inspired by bamboo - an important source of food, clothing, housing, and transportation for people in Guangzhou in ancient times - as the main modular element used in the facade. This metallic tube is also an interpretation of the \u2018O\u2019 in OPPO, when it is transformed from 2D into 3D. This dimensional transformation results in a cylindrical tube, into which a cut is added in order to obtain a truncated cylinder. This cylindrical form becomes the main modular element and is repeated throughout the facade, creating a reference to both the brand and to technology.\n\nFor the overall composition of the facade elements, multiple geometric strategies were studied. Following the exploration of different volumetric options, a large, sweeping folding gesture was chosen which echoes the corner curve of the OPPO brand logo, while guiding visitors towards the entrance to the store.\n\nLighting effects are then added to create an overall effect of dynamism and vibrancy. This results in an optical effect of rhythmic motion across the facade, representing the New OPPO Culture, new technologies and the pulse of OPPO as a company experiencing continuous growth.\n\nAt the indoor entrance, located within the mall, a \u2018grey space\u2019 space is created between the interior and the atrium. Here the materials used in the interiors and large LED screens extend from inside the store out into the atrium, minimising the store\u2019s boundary.",
			"The Interior \u2013 Fluid, Continuous Geometry\nAchieving a fluid space in a flowing, uninterrupted yet dynamic way - where an intuitive sequence of different areas enables customers to experience and interact with the products - was one of the key aims of the interior design.\n\nThe interior space is defined by two main areas: PULSE and EVOLUTION. In the PULSE area the main phone displays act as a strong focal point, while the EVOLUTION area, in contrast, enables different experiences and accommodates a caf\u00e9 and social zones. Throughout the store charging seats are installed around translucent pillars. Referencing social clusters around trees in a park, these seating elements provide comfortable areas for customers to relax and socialise. The store also provides customers with a playful experience zone, where they are also encouraged to discover the features of the phone\u2019s cameras by taking photos and selfies.\n\nNatural colours and fluid forms are applied in the interior. Anodized aluminum plate with a customised surface treatment is used alongside micro and translucent textured partitions, creating the perception of subtly layered changes of depth throughout the interior. Green granite terrazzo flooring is used to create meandering paths through the store, while integrated \u2018pathways\u2019 of lighting in the ceiling mimic this fluid flow and frame the different areas and displays from above. These pathways in the floor and ceiling further serve to guide visitors intuitively along various routes as they wander through and around the space."

To do this, RESET provides wearable technology (brain and heart sensors) that monitor biofeedback and user activity outside the pods, while sensors integrate data to personalise user experience inside the pods. With this information, the The Reset Index\u2122, a proprietary algorithm that combines head and heart data, can analyse the user\u2019s psychophysiological state.\n\nBased on how the user responds to active versus passive experiences in the pods, the algorithm determines their resilience to stress and recommends the most suitable types of stress reduction methods.",

The Laneways are surrounded by historical blue stone buildings and provide a calm and peaceful environment away from the activity of King Street, which sits on the fringe of the city\u2019s legal precinct and in the evening is known as a hub of Melbourne nightlife. The proposed development will provide a food and beverage focus to the laneways, reinvigorating and activating this currently neglected space.\n\n\u201cThe 570 Little Bourke project will unlock a piece of Melbourne for the public again with a 180 degree activated public podium that connects to the intimate hidden square via the newly activated Brown Alley. We are very proud to be able to contribute to this development and bring new life and quality to the area.\u201d  Ben van Berkel, Founder and Principal Architect UNStudio",
			"Urban Design Response\nOur design integrates a central vertical spine facing King Street, which adds social and green spaces that work in collaboration with the outer public realm. It\u2019s not only a physical design feature, but also promoted a functional relationship between the street and the spine. At the ground level, the spine recess invites users inside the building and provides a sheltered zone while respecting the existing heritage building. At the office levels, the spine hosts various collaboration and breakout spaces.",
			"Differing Facade Types\nThe subdivision of the building into various block forms is broken down into a finer grain through a palette of facade textures. Seven facade families are designed to populate the blocks and bring a rich, tactile differentiation to the overall facade. For the tower volume on the corner of King Street and Little Bourke, we employed a simple curtain wall system combined with vertical solid elements to reduce heat load on the interior. These solid elements pick up pace along the length of King Street and Browne Alley. On the Little Bourke side, which receives less heat, we embraced maximum facade transparency to optimise the amount of daylight flooding into the office levels and the views over King Street and the city skyline.\n\n\u201cThis development will elevate the quality and offering of our workplaces with future-proofed workplace design, superior amenity and unparalleled design excellence\u201d. Nick Argyrou, Managing Director, Argo Group\n\n\u201cThe power of 570 Little Bourke is a fusion of the boutique sectors, which blurs between corporate, hospitality and retail. The design combines environments that blend the best of them all\u201c. Igor Kebel, Co-Founder and Principal Architect XO Projects"

Just like urban form, Hangang\u2019s green spaces manifest themselves in different shapes and forms. Besides traditional parks, urban gardens and pocket parks, our proposal offers productive and technological landscapes. With the new approach to landscape design we restore the nature systems that were there before, enhance the existing and introduce new eco-systems which contribute to health and productivity of Handan. In order to secure the success of future urban development, cities can no longer be seen as solely economic-profit driven spaces. They must offer qualitative natural environments that are weaved into their urban fabric in order to be considered livable, and desirable.",

By designing an environment of diversity and opportunity we encourage the local community to flourish, attract and foster new talent that contributes to the future-proofing of Handan. The vision of Hangang\u2019s urban development will secure its legacy as part of Handan\u2019s economic power, political center, a capital of arts and culture, while opening up new opportunities for its residents and industries.

They are strengthened by their connection to the exterior and with green areas which further blur the boundaries of interior and exterior and increase the performance, motivation and efficiency of the users.\n\nThe workspace is designed to serve three main different types of activity, in order to guarantee flexibility of usage. Typical cccupants are freelancers, entrepreneurs, start-ups and small teams that require dynamic, versatile and varied workspaces.  A personalised environment, alongside communication suites includes both individual and group workspaces.\n\nFormal office layouts per floor - that are supported by optimal daylight conditions - include small break-out spaces for social interaction. This layout is optimised for focused work where full concentration is required.\n\nThe collaborative office levels are designed to foster workplace communities and teamwork. Circulation and workplace zones are arranged to encourage interaction and communication. High flexibility and a diversity of spaces provide the opportunity to attract different users.\n\nThe design of creative workspace revolves around the concept of \u2018encountering\u2019. As such the CityLife workspaces are designed to inspire; to provide a catalyst for spontaneous interactions and the exchange of ideas. These offices are a combination of shared individual and teamwork spaces, which are linked visually to stimulate social activity and accelerate the generation of innovation.",
			"A Sustainable Approach\nOur vision for CityLife also included sustainable and circular design features, with the aim to make the development more green.\n\nAs part of this, we included rainwater harvesting provisions, grey water recycling facilities, urban farming areas, and solar panels on the rooves. We also applied specific orientations to the buildings to reduce solar radiation."

			"Design Approach\nThe goal was to create a bridge between the existing rational design approach and one that is human-centric. Alongside the international style of the original tower design by Architects Vikelas, Molfezis and Loizos, the reference to the famous grid of Hippodamus is retained.\n\nThe design of the new tower is envisaged as a vessel of life and of diverse activities, thus stepping away from the monolithic image. A series of ribbons are introduced that frame the tower closer to the urban scale, where the building becomes a series of stacked blocks with different characteristics from street to top.\n\nThe heart of the new Piraeus Tower becomes the point where the tower meets the podium, while the podium is opened up to create an interior passage, enabling daylight to guide movement. The podium terrace becomes the shared place of the new community, where they can meet, work and play.",
			"Our proposal presents Piraeus as a place of synergies; between natural and manmade, arrival and departure, rational and organic, cityscape and seascape. Inspiration is taken from all these dualities and a fa\u00e7ade is introduced that performs as a veil; a play between seeing through and feeling protected, harnessing the wind and reflecting the water.\n\nThroughout the plinth and tower, the veil acts as a second skin and consists of a series of crafted and performative fins. Through an informed design process, the frequency and depth of the fins is altered to generate a ripple effect, creating the effect of a breeze across the surface, while protecting the building from site and environmental conditions. The fins respond to a set of contextual, performative and programmatic parameters, producing a different effect on each side of the building. Through the control of a set of fin variables: length, depth and coloration, the fins acoustically shield the building from interruption from the hustle and bustle of the city. In addition they block the strong summer sun while enabling a diffused light to enter the interior spaces. The irregular distribution of fins breaks down the vertical exterior surface of the Tower, thus interrupting the wind downfall and ensuring the comfort of all the surrounding public spaces.",
			"The interior glazed skin ensures the functional requirements of the tenants, whilst remaining transparent and causing the least visual impact. An Important goal of the facade design is to allow the soft Attica sky light into the building, as well as to capture the sea breeze through air-hatches that can be manually operated by the tenants. These parameters ensure the health and productive well-being of tenants in their workspaces.\n\nThe proposed facade design approach capitalises on the flexibility of the existing Tower. Recognising the dynamic environment in which we live, with plenty of economic and social fluctuations, the resilient approach will contribute to a future-proof design for Piraeus Tower. By breaking the building into a series of blocks, its relevance to the human and urban scale is ensured. By introducing the design approach of a holistic veil all programmes gain consistent value from the stunning views that the Tower has to offer."

Flexible subdivisions and the unique corner addresses of the podiums will not only attract a broad range of commercial tenancies, the design also envisages the development of leisure and community facilities within the complex, as a result establishing Lewisham Gateway as an attractive location that is vibrant and inclusive for all residents and visitors to the area.",
			"Residential\nBlocks D1, D2 and C represent the residential portions of the complex. These residential blocks are designed and orientated in a way that provides maximum daylight, aspect and privacy to the users. The vast majority of units have dual aspect views towards the city, while only a small number have single aspect views. Dual aspect has significant implications on the quality of the residential environment by maximising sunlight and daylight, extending views, allowing privacy and improving air quality in flats. Furthermore, the rational design of the apartments will allow multiple furniture layouts and flexibility for the use of the spaces.",
			"Diverse Programme Mixes\nBlock C is defined by its mixed programme, complemented with formal diversity and material richness. The block is composed of two taller elements on the southern end containing apartments and to the north, a lower structure containing co-living spaces. These structures are bridged by a large plinth which houses a seven-screen cinema and a number of food & beverage and retail spaces.",
			"Circulation, Access and Connection\nProposed ground floor uses, frontages and entrances have been designed and positioned to reinforce pedestrian flows. In terms of internal access and movement within the blocks, the design of Block E provides a strong structural anchor within the complex, in turn providing a seamless connection to the public space. The design aims to create opportunities for northern access and ultimately to act as an urban generator to the community through its public uses which include 25,000 sq ft of retail space, 15,000 sq ft of restaurants and bars, a gym, and Lewisham\u2019s first major multiplex cinema.",
			"Sustainability\nThe design aims to extend Lewisham Gateway\u2019s positive insertion into the community by adopting energy and sustainability strategies. The aim of these strategies is to adopt a \u2018fabric and energy efficiency first\u2019 approach, followed by the implementation of district heating, and Low and Zero Carbon technologies, to reduce energy consumption and associated carbon emissions. This objective is currently proposed to be achieved through passive design and energy efficiency measures, the implementation of central Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant, and an array of photovoltaic panels."

			"A Special Relationship: Stronger Together\nThe Dutch enjoy a successful historical football friendship with South Korea that dates back to 2002, when internationally celebrated Dutch coach Guus Hiddink spectacularly led the South Korean national team to the quarterfinals and a final fourth place - an unprecedented achievement in Korean football history.\n\nFor the development of the masterplan, an international team of leading football stadium managers were gathered, alongside specialists in sports science and digital data collection. This team of industry specialists has worked with world-renowned football leagues and stadiums throughout Europe and the Middle East. The essential elements for the masterplan are therefore based on lessons learned from other top international football clubs and training centres.\n\n\u201cThe Netherlands is a very proud footballing nation. We have many top players and trainers in teams all over the globe. As the inventors of \u2018Total Football\u2019, to us football is not just a sport; it\u2019s an expression of culture, a science and a philosophy. Football brings people together, it provides them with a sense of comradery, of belonging and of national pride.\u201d\n\n- Ben van Berkel, Founder & Principal Architect, UNStudio \n\n\u201cWe are grateful to be chosen for this immensely prestigious project. The Johan Cruijff ArenA is honoured and proud to be part of realising such a prominent and iconic training complex for a country that is advancing technologically in such a way that it serves as an example to us all.\n\n- Henk Markerink, CEO Johan Cruijff ArenA",
			"The Future of Korean Football\nLocated in Cheonan-shi, Chungnam-do, the masterplan for the new National Football Centre (NFC) envisions the future of Korean football, for which an international presence is crucial.\n\nIn the new NFC, the women\u2019s team and youth teams share the facilities with the men\u2019s national team. The youth training facilities are designed to cultivate top league players, with training from international coaches and specific emphasis on the development of their physical and mental health. However, the centre is also designed to become an attractive destination for football fans to enjoy the story of Korean football and use the facilities in order to fully tap into the energy of the league.\n\nBased on the latest insights into sports science and data technology, the National Football Centre will be an exceptional professional football facility housing two stadiums and over a dozen sports field typologies, natural running tracks and indoor gymnasiums. These facilities will be closely linked to the numerous specialist sports medics and treatment centres that will ensure that the athletes can perform at the top of their game.\n\nA high-end hotel with inside and outside lounge areas, spa, sauna and wellness centre will ensure that the NFC also offers exclusive facilities for players to rest and relax before and after training.\n\nThe focal point of the masterplan will be the central public plaza, located at the heart of the complex. Here, three primary pieces of architecture - the museum, the indoor stadium and the outdoor stadium - will frame a public pedestrian area that houses restaurants, shops and a variety of (semi) public sports facilities. With its tiered landscape, the large plaza can also host multi-functional events throughout the year.",
			"A New Branding Manual\nIn addition to the masterplan design, the international competition required that the overall design create a strong brand for the site. In order to ensure cohesiveness throughout the architecture and landscaping of the complex, a novel \u2018urban branding manual\u2019 was created. This manual serves as a blueprint for key architectural and urban aspects of the masterplan and outlines specifications for various scales of detail that adhere to the original guiding principles of the design.",
			"The Science of Sport: Health, Wellness, Science and Technology\nTogether with key sponsors and industry leaders, the NFC training facility will lead the way in sports innovation by focusing on \u2018Health, Wellness, Science, and Technology\u2019, forming a branding strategy that also strengthens the commercial position of the facility.\n\nHealth\nIt has recently been discovered that the physical development of young athletes can be improved if they are exposed to a variety of sporting activities that sharpen their motor skills and reflexes. Multiple training and conditioning techniques help improve a player\u2019s performance. For this reason, the new NFC is home to over a dozen various sporting field typologies, natural running tracks, and indoor gymnasiums.\n\nWellness\nMental health is closely linked to the physical body\u2019s development and nourishment. As a result, the campus not only provides facilities for the players to rest, relax and relieve stress, the material palette is derived from this essential driver. Where possible, local natural materials of raw and exposed stone, timber, and textiles are employed, while an abundance of vegetation and green space is provided, thus embedding the campus into the surrounding landscape of farmland and hills sides.\n\nScience and Technology\nInvesting in the next generation of athletes is key to the success of any sports programme. The NFC will therefore become a laboratory for, not only training the first national team, but also for the training of youth leagues and woman\u2019s teams involved in the sport. This collective gathering of various levels of athletes will provide sports medicine scientists with the wide-ranging data they need to evaluate and custom tailor different training regimens.\n\nDigital technology has permeated sports allowing coaches, management and health care services to track the progress and development of sports programs yielding the greatest results from their facilities. The UNStudio team has specific knowledge of discretely integrating digital technology into the built environment for data collection related to the user\u2019s health, activity, time and schedule allocation, in addition to other bio-metrics."

The development has a strong focus on sustainability: \u2018smart\u2019 buildings with high energy performance, a car-free zone and a diversity of developed public and green spaces. It would also become the second largest green park in Milan.\n\nThe brief for the CityLife International Design Competition was to complete the development by designing the last two remaining plots, with the urban area in between. To add this last chapter to CityLife, it was essential to understand the importance of the project as an urban and real estate development.

The aim is to attract different user types to CityLife in order to create social diversity. The target of all design decisions is to establish quality space for people to dwell and to engage with; space which will engender strong emotional attachments, which form the cornerstone of community building. Attractive and comfortable workspaces, public space and intimate green areas that people will want to return to time and time again, and a memorable hotel. The design aims to connect people and strengthen CityLife\u2019s position as a Milan destination for visitors and locals alike. The design subtly relates to the former fairground; its aim to entertain, the playfulness of its details and Its social accessibility.",
			"Spatial Experience\nThe two towers are shaped by consciously set programmatic intentions. The volumes reflect the changes in the spatial requirements of the interiors and their functions. The facade openings signal changes in function, while connecting the indoor and outdoor environments. Social spaces are clustered in the large gestures of the volumes in order to activate the buildings vertically and create space for interaction. These spaces also introduce a biophilic green environment to the interior.\n\nThe indoor environment is inspired by traditional Milanese interiors and uses only circular materials, which support the zero energy target. The interior is designed to be a responsive environment where specific elements are in dialogue with the users. For instance the lighting is controlled by occupancy, but can also be personalised it in the common spaces. The data analysis based monitoring of the spaces makes operations efficient and the user experience bespoke.\n\nA hotel is located in the higher tower at the top of the development, thereby fully utilising the potential of the CityLife site. The design of the hotel originates from traditional Milanese courtyards. The lobby is located in a floating garden that expands through the hotel volume, floating above the entire office block and CityLife. Upon arrival, visitors find themselves in a semi-outdoor, green and lush garden. All of the hotel rooms are accessed from this space, which also offers the most spectacular views of Milan.",

		"description": "CityLife is an ambitious commercial and residential development on Milan\u2019s historic former trade fair grounds: the Fiera Milano. The development has a strong focus on sustainability: \u2018smart\u2019 buildings with high energy performance, a car-free zone and a diversity of developed public and green spaces. It would also become the second largest green park in Milan.\n\nThe brief for the CityLife International Design Competition was to complete the development by designing the last two remaining plots, with the urban area in between. To add this last chapter to CityLife, it was essential to understand the importance of the project as an urban and real estate development. After thorough analysis, UNStudio proposed to aim for a finely crafted, high performance urban campus and create diversity in both function and architecture, as well as form a stronger transition between the existing urban fabric and the connecting neighbourhoods.\n\nUNStudio\u2019s concept is data-driven and based on variables that define efficiency, constructability, flexibility, sustainability and wellbeing, with an overall emphasis on craftsmanship. The design is centred around people and focusses on the comfort and wellbeing of each person who would work in, live in or simply pass by CityLife. The design offers a memorable and engaging space; a healthy recreational and working environment. The proposal encompasses physical, mental, social and environmental health. The new campus layout aims to result in a framework for the built environment and space where elements and solutions are human-centric and implement the most progressive level of engineering, innovation and sustainability.",

			"Urban Regeneration\nThe newly proposed buildings are predominantly different from their surroundings. A new resolution and quality is introduced in the architecture and the landscape. The aim is to attract different user types to CityLife in order to create social diversity. The target of all design decisions is to establish quality space for people to dwell and to engage with; space which will engender strong emotional attachments, which form the cornerstone of community building. Attractive and comfortable workspaces, public space and intimate green areas that people will want to return to time and time again, and a memorable hotel. The design aims to connect people and strengthen CityLife\u2019s position as a Milan destination for visitors and locals alike. The design subtly relates to the former fairground; its aim to entertain, the playfulness of its details and Its social accessibility.",
			"Spatial Experience\nThe two towers are shaped by consciously set programmatic intentions. The volumes reflect the changes in the spatial requirements of the interiors and their functions. The facade openings signal changes in function, while connecting the indoor and outdoor environments. Social spaces are clustered in the large gestures of the volumes in order to activate the buildings vertically and create space for interaction. These spaces also introduce a biophilic green environment to the interior.\n\nThe indoor environment is inspired by traditional Milanese interiors and uses only circular materials, which support the zero energy target. The interior is designed to be a responsive environment where specific elements are in dialogue with the users. For instance the lighting is controlled by occupancy, but can also be personalised it in the common spaces. The data analysis based monitoring of the spaces makes operations efficient and the user experience bespoke.\n\nA hotel is located in the higher tower at the top of the development, thereby fully utilising the potential of the CityLife site. The design of the hotel originates from traditional Milanese courtyards. The lobby is located in a floating garden that expands through the hotel volume, floating above the entire office block and CityLife. Upon arrival, visitors find themselves in a semi-outdoor, green and lush garden. All of the hotel rooms are accessed from this space, which also offers the most spectacular views of Milan.",

		"description": "In recent years, wellness has become a central focus in many people\u2019s lifestyles, influencing and guiding the way they interact with the world. In prioritising their physical and mental wellbeing, people also look to their built environments and how these spaces impact on their health and comfort. Core to this is their homes.\n\nUNStudio\u2019s experience design team, UNSx, was commissioned by heritage German sanitary ware manufacturer Kaldewei to explore how an increased focus on wellness could influence bathrooms of the future, and to use this research to define development scenarios for the brand, taking into consideration any needs for changes in the product offering, the business model, and the customer experience strategy.\n\nTo do this, we used co-creative workshops with the Kaldewei team to answer four key questions: how can we turn bathrooms into experience rooms? How will changing demographics influence user needs around bathroom products? What role will new technologies have in the bathroom? Will technology enable us to turn the bathroom from a place of necessity into a personalised space of calm and convenience?",

			"The Work Process\nTo look towards the future of bathrooms, we first went back to the very essence of what these rooms are used for \u2013 bathing. This ritualistic activity can be a rejuvenating and calming experience, but it can also bring hassle and stress.\n\nTwo key areas that can induce this are the cleaning process, which is more demanding than other rooms in the home, especially for family units, and safety for elderly people. We used these areas as the basis for a series of co-creative workshops in which we gathered designers, product managers, and strategists in the world of bathrooms, spa, and hammams to come up with solutions that would make the bathroom experience more enjoyable for everyone.\n\nThe first workshop focused on the scenario of improving the convenience of the cleaning process, particularly for elderly users. The second was concentrated on young families who struggle with raising kids and managing household duties. The third speculated on the use of new technology in the bathroom experience, such as augmented reality and voice interface.",
			"Customising Bathroom Experiences\nThe process resulted in an experience concept and a mock-up for an app that could customise the bathroom environment to individual preferences. The concept bridges sensory experiences related to touch, light and temperature with bathroom products, and includes a digital interface that configures the environment to optimise the experience for health and wellbeing."

			"Programme\nThe three towers within the development accommodate different living typologies. One of the towers will house the Mandarin Oriental Etiler Hotel, with 158 guestrooms and suites and 16 serviced apartments. The remaining two towers will house numerous residences at Mandarin Oriental.\n\nThe hotel will have three restaurants and bars, a selection of adaptable meeting spaces with outdoor areas and terraces, a spa and fitness centre, and both an indoor and outdoor swimming pool. The residences at Mandarin Oriental will enjoy direct access to the hotel\u2019s facilities, in addition to bespoke resident facilities, which include two outdoor swimming pools and a fitness centre.\n\nThe commercial plinth comprises retail shops, offices and public amenities. It extends to three levels below the garden level and is accessible directly from the commercial plaza entrance at Selcuklar Sk.",
			"The Urban Plan\nWith its unique topography, the beauty of Bosporus and the amalgamation of different cultures throughout the centuries, Istanbul provides its residents with a varied and rich quality of life. This new mixed-use development in Etiler reflects the contemporary lifestyle of both local and international people who want to be part of this vibrant and modern metropolis.\n\nThe site is located in the district of Be\u015fikta\u015f, close to the business quarters of Levent and Maslak and within easy walking distance of Akmerkez shopping mall. The three entrances to the project are formed by the hotel lobby at the southern tip of the site, the residential lobby that faces inwards for privacy, and the commercial plaza entrance. There is also a three-level parking area below the commercial plinth which services the residences, the hotel and the public programme.\n\nTaking advantage of the existing slope on the site, the podium appears to be partially tucked underground. This gesture not only reduces the impact of the volume at the urban scale, but also enables the lush garden area to be highly visible to the whole neighborhood, thereby adding to the quality of living in Etiler.",
			"Green, Well-Being & Health\nThe starting point for the design of the urban plan was to create a large lush garden that provides a unique experience for the residents, as well as for the surrounding neighbourhood. The full landscaped area of 31,885 m2 is used for the garden, which becomes the reference point for the whole design. The garden accentuates the feeling of spaciousness and connectivity, while providing a varied landscape with activity areas for both the residents and guests.\n\nThe garden is the unifying plane of the whole project. With a single gesture, it extends upwards to the towers, creating numerous dedicated garden terraces for the special residences. It signifies the transition from the shared area - with facilities that include two outdoor pools and several pavilions - to the privately owned areas, which enjoy private pools alongside areas of paving and green.\n\nThe garden is intended to empower healthy living; the design amplifies active circulation, while providing opportunities for exercise alongside a multitude of green spaces in which residents can live, work and play in local proximity. The large garden is designed as a place for gathering and a space for physical and psychological comfort and stimulation.",
			"Sculpted Living\nThe design of the towers plays a key role in the implementation of sustainability measures, which begin with the massing. Their placement is the result of parametric testing to find an optimal position that would avoid casting shadows on each other and on the garden in the afternoon hours, and minimise any impact on the surrounding neighbourhood. The facade length is also maximised in order to provide all residences with views over the Bosporus waterway.\n\nThe form of the towers results in a sculpted, fanning effect. The top floors gradually step inwards at the side with the most prominent views, in order to allow for larger penthouse terraces. The central levels, which form the core of the tower, host most of the residences. Meanwhile, the lower floors, where the fanning is most evident, establish the connection with the garden.\n\nThe fanning enables the towers to seamlessly merge with the garden, as the two elements come together to provide a healthy biophilic element that increases the occupants\u2019 connectivity to the natural environment.",
			"Villa Living in the Sky\nTo ensure stunning views on all sides of the site, we introduced a glass facade that wraps around the towers. A horizontal ribbon then winds around each floor and introduces variety to the balustrade design.\n\nThe terraces also contribute significantly to the reduction of the heat load on the large glass surfaces of the towers. Aside from the terraces, a continuous French Balcony surrounds the full plan, providing access to all rooms. This means all rooms can also enjoy natural ventilation, while apartments have the opportunity to cross-ventilate, thereby reducing the need for air-conditioning and lowering energy usage.\n\nTo accentuate the individuality of each residence, each terrace extends or recesses in relation to the terrace above it. As a result, every resident enjoys a double-height outdoor living space, creating an experience of villa living in the sky of Istanbul.",
			"Designing with Craftsmanship\nThe aim of the facade design for the Mandarin Oriental Hotel and Residences is to employ materials that portray artistry, wherein hand-craftsmanship is evident in the quality of the design and workmanship. Metalwork, pottery, ceramics and woodwork, become the references for the principal materials used in the project.\n\nThe anthracite ribbons are clad with glazed ceramic tiles, inspired by centuries of tradition and knowledge, in addition to a multicultural mixture of influences. These tiles are cast in such a way as to catch the light differently across the course of the day.\n\nIn addition, bronze details throughout the project give the feeling of both tradition and exclusivity. Such details are employed in the lobby areas and in the ceiling design of the terraces.\n\nA sense of place at the commercial entrance is achieved by introducing wooden frame elements. The detailing of the frames not only incorporate the technical requirements for ventilation, but also reflect the honing of the design to achieve a natural and tactile environment."

		"description": "Our proposal for The Cloud @ Donaumarina is a sustainable and dynamic architectural ambition that creates a new benchmark for working environments in Vienna. The Donaumarina District along the river Danube is currently defined by a mosaic of building proportions and programmes, ranging from small-scale houses to high-rise offices, all within close proximity to each other. In response to these existing contrasts, The Cloud @ Donaumarina rotates facade volumes at different heights, allowing the building to connect and integrate appropriately with its surroundings. The facade interchanges from smaller human-scale volumes along the pedestrian level to bigger volumes at the top, creating a unique addition to the waterfront skyline. Together with its neighboring tower, it creates an urban ensemble in the city\u2019s rapidly developing Donaumarina District.",

			"Design Concept\nWhile many office towers are often indifferent to their context, The Cloud proposes a design that responds to its surroundings and to the people at work within. Inside the building, strategically rotated volumes create dynamic spaces of work, with a floorplate that provides corner offices for all workers. Furthermore, all spaces within the building can be customised and enhanced through a curated set of spatial plugins which are interchangeable on any floorplate. From the outside, the pedestrian eye level is brought to a human scale through more frequent facade rotations, attracting the public realm into the building. Larger rotated volumes elevated above the neighbouring buildings offer bigger floorplates, which respond accordingly to the scale of the surrounding city and landscapes.",
			"The Wooden Workplace\nIn order to create a sustainable tower that prioritises the health and well-being of its users, the majority of The Cloud is made from wood. Visible wooden floors, columns and beams create a warm interior atmosphere. Together with a concrete core and steel beams along the edges, the tower rises up to 103 meters. If built, it would become the tallest timber high-rise in Austria. To ensure that the wooden structure is also visible from the outside, the design introduces a system of motorised wooden shutters along the facade that protect the interior from too much sunlight, while at the same saving energy when closed.",
			"The Silver Lining\nTaking inspiration from cloud computing, The Cloud is a network of wooden volumes wrapped in glass, creating an open and transparent space that connects to its surroundings. Holding the health and wellbeing of its users at its core, The Cloud helps working communities to connect to each other. Nodes of single protruding units shape new working environments, generating a unique identity and community for the Donaumarina District."

			"Gateway to Xintiandi\nIn collaboration with Shui On Land \u2013 owners of both the Shui On Plaza and the Xintiandi developments \u2013 a strategy was established to turn the Shui On plaza into the gateway to the Xintiandi area, thereby enabling a transition and fusion of the international high-end fashion street Huai Hai Road and the traditional small scale Shikumen architecture lifestyle and F&B area.\n\nThe main concept for the Xintiandi Plaza design is to compile and compose these differing local characteristics within one building. This is achieved by stacking them vertically to create a landscape of different experiences. These experiences will be placed within the building envelope in key positions that are visible from the street, thereby allowing a glimpse of the activities taking place within and blurring the boundaries between the inside and outside space.\n\nInside the mall, elements of outdoor street life are mixed with lifestyle retail features and are distributed throughout the building. Resembling a leisurely stroll outside, this organisation encourages the visitor to wander through and explore the different levels of the building, where retail spaces follow an open layout and are punctuated with small kiosks.\n ",
			"Banded inside-out\nThe cylindrical tower geometry from the north-west corner of the existing building gives rise to the idea of undulating bands that define the building and determine the breakdown of the volume. These bands further create terraces and connect to the plaza and the street level. In the interior, the bands form atria and create a variety of activity spaces. Exterior and interior space are therefore controlled by the bands, which connect programme and activities by seamlessly moving through the facade layer and continuing into the interior.\n\nIn addition to this horizontal interconnectivity, several spaces are also connected in a vertical direction.

			"Gateway to Xintiandi\nIn collaboration with Shui On Land \u2013 owners of both the Shui On Plaza and the Xintiandi developments \u2013 a strategy was established to turn the Shui On plaza into the gateway to the Xintiandi area, thereby enabling a transition and fusion of the international high-end fashion street Huai Hai Road and the traditional small scale Shikumen architecture lifestyle and F&B area.\n\nThe main concept for the Xintiandi Plaza design is to compile and compose these differing local characteristics within one building. This is achieved by stacking them vertically to create a landscape of different experiences. These experiences will be placed within the building envelope in key positions that are visible from the street, thereby allowing a glimpse of the activities taking place within and blurring the boundaries between the inside and outside space.\n\nInside the mall, elements of outdoor street life are mixed with lifestyle retail features and are distributed throughout the building. Resembling a leisurely stroll outside, this organisation encourages the visitor to wander through and explore the different levels of the building, where retail spaces follow an open layout and are punctuated with small kiosks.\n ",
			"Banded inside-out\nThe cylindrical tower geometry from the north-west corner of the existing building gives rise to the idea of undulating bands that define the building and determine the breakdown of the volume. These bands further create terraces and connect to the plaza and the street level. In the interior, the bands form atria and create a variety of activity spaces. Exterior and interior space are therefore controlled by the bands, which connect programme and activities by seamlessly moving through the facade layer and continuing into the interior.\n\nIn addition to this horizontal interconnectivity, several spaces are also connected in a vertical direction. The sunken plaza located towards Huai Hai Road connects the street level to the basement metro entry, while stacked balconies connect the ground level all the way to the roof garden. All platforms, terraces and outdoor spaces are planted with lush vegetation in order to create a new green urban landscape for this vertical city centre concept.",

			"Urban Pillars\nThe strong bearing towards nature came about upon the consideration of Xingtai\u2019s history and culture. As the area is and has always been closely tied to rivers, the starting point of the project very quickly oriented towards designing the future city along the river.\nWith these goals in mind, UNStudio\u2019s vision adheres to five key urban pillars that would transform and shape Xingdong New Area into a resilient urban environment. The five urban pillars refer to the principles of five C\u2019s \u2013 Connectivity, Creativity, Cleanliness, Community and Cleverness. Connectivity refers to creating physical and social connections within the system; Creativity refers to the fostering of innovation and the making of room for culture, arts and new industries; Cleanliness refers to maintaining of a safe and clean environment; Community refers to the pursuance of interactive experiences; and Clever, refers to the emergence of a sensor-based city that is smart and flexible.",
			"New Communities\nXingdong New Area is a place for people. For the ease of navigation, UNStudio proposed to develop and divide the city into five different neighbourhoods, each with its own identity, corresponding dominant typologies and supporting amenities. The five neighbourhoods correspond to five different potential user groups: the Artists, the Educators, the Makers, the Innovators and the Urbanists.\nXingdong New Area will bring 200,000 new residents and 2,500,000 daily commuters into the new district, increasing the current urban population by 70%. Taking into consideration this large influx of people and goods, UNStudio\u2019s urban plan envisages maximizing social comfort by introducing a sense of belonging and overall well-being amongst the new communities.\nCatering to the users\u2019 wellbeing and adhering to the principle of sustainability, Xingdong New Area is designed as a walkable district, which encourages people to live a healthy and active lifestyle in the long run. Amenities are located at a close and convenient proximity: all residential units are located within a 10-minute walk to parks and shops. In favouring pedestrians, all streets are equipped with wide sidewalks, and at the core of the district, there is a designated \u2018Eco Spine\u2019 zone that will remain vehicle-free.\nIn terms of urban life, different key moments are plugged into the masterplan to further enhance urban qualities, whilst encouraging social interactions and the development of new iconic destinations in the city.",
			"High-Speed, Low-Speed\nIn order to embrace diversity and cater to different user groups, UNStudio\u2019s urban vision identified and considered six types of social units during the configuration of different neighbourhoods within the Xingdong New Area. These units are categorised based on age groups and rhythm, or pace of life, ranging from high-energy, fast-paced living to low-energy, slow-paced living."

			"The Blue City\nOur main concept revolves around the establishment of the Blue City, a synthesis of water and technology.\n\nThe site, located just south of Budapest\u2019s city centre, bears a strong relationship to the neighbouring Danube river. This mighty waterway has frequently overflowed into the site previously, but instead of cordoning off the river with embankments or levees, our proposal involves a strategy for the natural formation of wetlands in order to benefit from the surrounding water in the area.\n\nThe changing water levels are beneficial for a wide variety of ecological zones. A network of streams, fish ramps, wetlands and water filtering foliage would allow nature to flourish and allow for the return of local wildlife. The blue-green infrastructure is developed on a sponge city model, to ensure the mitigation of rain and flooding events.",
			"A skywalk, hovering above the area, does not interfere with natural processes. In this way, the waterfront becomes transformed into a rich ecological habitat and a prime destination throughout the year.\nThe second aspect of the Blue City concept focuses on the implementation of a technological layer. Local heritage is revitalised in order to serve future needs. The old railway tracks are transformed into a smart spine with self-driving cars and electrical charging station, whilst the Wholesale Market Hall is converted into a startup-hub with innovation plazas of various themes.\nAll together, these elements of the masterplan serve public life and a proactive generation that is committed to driving positive change for Budapest.",
			"A Synergy of Ecology and Community\nWith over 40 colleges and universities located in the city, this lively capital has notable innovation capabilities as a technology and business incubator.\n\nOur masterplan for Budapest\u2019s South Gate accommodates 12,000 students, 4,000 members of young families and enables 20,000 work places for new businesses. This is combined with a 77-hectare-park for top athletes, and is all created in synergy with the local ecology and wildlife.\n\nLarge parts of the programme are linked to water and ecology. The functions of the sports park for example are embedded within the landscape, whilst the student city has an active boulevard along the canal, and the local heritage and residential areas are surrounded by parklands that host a broad range of social functions.",
			"Seven Unique Neighbourhoods\nOur masterplan proposal tackles the large scale of the site by developing seven distinctive yet interconnected neighbourhoods, which each celebrate their own unique identity and expression: the active sports park, the riparian ecological promenade, the heritage & innovation neighbourhood, the events district, the Danubius gateway, the urban retreat and the extended city.\nEach zone has a specific anchor point that activates its natural surrounding with a diverse and cohesive set of programming. A meandering path binds each zone together allowing for clear future-proof phasing & accessibility to all throughout the masterplan.\nLarge car-free zones, social courtyards, parklands and a network of decentralised fitness and sport activities together facilitate a healthy lifestyle, nudging towards better decision making through spatial design and accessibility, to both the broader community and the sports elite.\nThe plan builds on research that indicates that zip codes are more important than genetic codes, meaning our surroundings we live and grow up in are trumping the base genetic code we start with. Ecology, livability, community are therefore all threads in the fabric of health the masterplan aims to weave to ensure future citizens and athletes will thrive."

		"description": "Will offices still exist in 50 years\u2019 time? UNStudio\u2019s Futures team, together with Swiss furniture brand USM, has designed a theatrical installation to reflect shifting boundaries between work and domesticity, now and in the future.\n\nUNStudio\u2019s Futures team was commissioned to explore changes taking place within the world of work, understand how these affect USM and identify opportunities for the future. Way back in 1930, economist John Maynard Keynes predicted that, by the early 21st century, advances in technology would lead to an \u201cage of leisure and abundance\u201d in which people might work 15 hour weeks.\n\nWell, it didn\u2019t exactly turn out that way. Work rules our lives today more than ever, and technology allows work to invade our leisure time. As digital nomads we are increasingly mobile, ready to set up office wherever we are. Caf\u00e9s resemble living rooms, restaurants feel like home kitchens, and co-working spaces have replaced the home office.\n\nUSM\u2019s booth marks the beginning of a long-term exploration for the company. UNStudio\u2019s design explodes the spaces in which we live, using the USM modular system as a platform to support an absurd hybrid of domestic and office environments hidden within four floating chambers: the Dining Room, the Bedroom, the Bathroom and the Home Office. Being highly sustainable, the single parts of the booth can be reused for the next project after Milan.\n\nOver the past few years, it has become conventional wisdom that automation, along with advances in artificial intelligence, have put us on the path to a jobless future. But all may not be doom and gloom. With the eradication of \u2018bad jobs\u2019 we can focus on finding meaning in our working lives. How can we learn more at work? How can we play?\n\nA question posed in each room prompts us to reflect on the human qualities which differentiate us from machines and invites visitors to enter a dialogue with USM. Will the future workplace be designed around qualities rather than professions? Will work in the future take place in an office at all? Feedback from visitors will inspire a WorkHouse this summer in Berlin, where we\u2019ll dive deeper into the idea of post-work and the need for lifelong learning to future-proof our careers.",

With a compulsory two minute walk through farmland, the approach to the museum creates a grounded, organic experience for visitors, allowing them to feel connected with the earth.\n\nThe building programme is distributed over three floor levels. At the entrance to the building, visitors are guided towards an introductory space and then onward towards the exhibition floors. The museum unfolds itself above and below the visitor through a sequence of immersive Marine and Celestial spheres. These spheres overlap with one another throughout the museum, allowing users to explore the skies above them and the sea below through sceographic storytelling.\n\nThe ground floor has a focus on educational and public programmes. It has a porous design approach, with a porous facade that connects with the outdoor farm. The exhibition continues through to the second floor, with open views on the surrounding landscape, with the main body of the exhibition located on the third floor. Finally, the roof terrace connects the visitors again to the outdoors.\n\nThe museum provides a singular place for people to reflect on their own interests and talents and to imagine, with a fresh perspective, how they might step back out in the surrounding gardens and further into the wider world to become a pioneer that will create a meaningful positive impact.",

And how can we connect the required technology with the people who live and work there? In our future vision, The CID, which is triangulated by The Hague Central Station and two nearby stations, becomes a green, self-sufficient double-layered district, where a new urban layer of housing, offices, urban mobility and park-like public space is created over the existing train track infrastructure.

This series of gateways works to supply local low rise houses with geothermal energy, provide high rise buildings with solar power, create urban irrigation systems, produce drinking water and reuse water to supply local water features. While having a practical function, the gateways also have a social purpose, becoming bridges that connect neighbourhoods, community gardens, urban farms, co-working spaces and start up spaces.

Although the overall sizes of the stainless steel bricks are the same as typical bricks, by tapering and softening the edges, the stainless steel bricks have a refined and intricately detailed appearance, with manually glued glass inlays.\nThe stainless steel bricks are cast in different sizes, following a similar pattern to the traditional brick facade on the upper levels. The individual stainless steel bricks are precisely mounted onto larger steel frames, then installed on site. Operable glass windows behind the steel brick facade allow for maintenance and cleaning.\nThe residential entrance door is composed of the same stainless steel bricks, but with an opaque glass inlay, ensuring privacy in the apartment entrance area. The stainless steel door handle and doorbell are also custom designed to integrate into the overall facade appearance.\nThe white steel window frames continue into the interior. Slanting the glass panels emphasises the dynamic of the white frames, a detail which is also continued in the smaller first floor windows."

			"An experience of light\nReflectivity and sheen are added to the facade through the ambitious construction of four large glass structures. At 5.5 meters wide, 7 meters high and weighing 3000kg each, these illuminated windows appear to float on the surface of the monumental facade. This effect was achieved through a close collaboration between ABT, Si-X and UNStudio, which resulted in the creation of interlocking and glued connections that form an \u2018invisible\u2019 support and mounting system.\nThis type and scale of glass facade construction has never before been realised in the Netherlands. In order to make the glued construction possible at such a large scale, the team undertook one a half years of extensive research - and of trial and error - before finally finding a solution that could provide the level of craftsmanship and engineering precision required.",
			"Glass Boxes\nAngled at 10 degrees to maximise visual connections at street level, the glass structures are illuminated by LED lighting \u2013 designed by the Dutch artist Arnout Meijer - which is reflected and diffused by a thin film on the inside of the glass. Optical effects created by this film form patterns of light, which appear to alter as people move across the square. As such, the original design motif of protruding glass windows is used to emphasise the heritage of the C&A Store, whilst strongly identifying it with The City of Light."

The accessory is designed to combine sculpted form with functionality; twisting steel evokes the intertwining roots where truffles grow, while the curved profile and 18\u00b0 angle between emphasises the ergonomics of the grip, reduces pressure on the wrist and distributes weight evenly to produce the perfect slice. An adjustment mechanism allows the user to vary the thickness of the slices from 0 to 3 millimetres, and allows the user to completely close the blade so the utensil can be stored away safely. \u2018Alba\u2019 is the two-year end product of the \u201cDe Truffle\u201d workshop that was launched in 2015 by Alessi, The National Centre for Truffle Studies and the International White Truffle Fair of Alba. At this workshop, fifteen designers were briefed to develop functional solutions for a utensil that has been used in kitchens for 300 years. From the fifteen designs that were developed over this period, Alessi chose to produce the \u2018Alba\u2019 truffle slicer designed by Ben van Berkel/UNStudio, taking account of technical feasibility, aesthetics and poetic force. \u2018Alba\u2019 is a functional table top microsculpture that offers a new aesthetic for slicing and serving the rare Alba White Truffle.\n\nAlberto Alessi: \u201cSubject to the assessment of the skilled Selection Committee, to the opinion of the public and to their technical feasibility; the one which was chosen is: Alba, designed by the Dutch architect Ben van Berkel who [\u2026] had a brilliant insight by bringing the concept back to the primordial typological reference of the item itself: the Plane.\u201d\n\nThe prototypes and concepts developed for the \u201cDe Truffle\u201d workshop will be exhibited at the \u201cDe Truffle.

Nonetheless, the trend analysis carried out by the team from passenger data at Schiphol Airport demonstrated a clear shift from a dominant vehicular traffic model to an increasingly interconnected public transport model.\n\nAs such, UNStudio, HOK and Arup envisioned the next step in this evolution to be the Intermodal Airport City.\n\nIn order to achieve this overall multimodal vision in the design, the new terminal is linked to the existing central public plazas and public transport links via the shortest possible route, while clear visual links enable users to intuitively choose their journey. A pedestrian bridge connects the new terminal with the large central indoor and outdoor plazas that house the current transport links (train, taxi and bus). The re-programming of this central heart of Schiphol, along with a human centric-approach, makes the intermodal hub a seamless part of the passenger journey.",

			"Creative Collaboration\nAt UNStudio we are often approached by clients and collaborators who come to us with an ambition \u2013 much as in the case of PROOFF \u2013 and we become the creative engine behind making these ambitions a reality. PROOFF originally approached us with the idea of displaying a large amount of furniture in a limited space, but their greater ambition is to redefine the future of workspaces while pushing the boundaries of furniture design. The concept of a proactive workspace became the key driver and catalyst to our experimentation with virtual reality.\n\nAs an architectural practice, while we often utilise high-resolution renderings, diagrams, drawings and/or sketches to represent our ideas and enable clients to connect with our solutions, we often desire to push these methods further. By constantly innovating our representational techniques, we endeavor to captivate the audience and storyline an idea, beyond traditional representation techniques. Because of our recent experience working with PROOFF, we have incorporated VR as an integral representational technique within UNStudio and will continue to explore new ways in which to use it.",
			"Advantages of VR\nThe advantages of using virtual reality are fast becoming apparent within the architectural design process. Our initial uses of VR were limited to additional presentation techniques in which we could give our clients a more experiential look into the spatial qualities of designs. These were often times seen as additive or 'special features' and were offered to few clients due to the high cost of production. Through our collaboration with PROOFF, we were able to experience a range of applications for VR beyond merely an additional representational technique. Currently we have set up a dedicated VR room within UNStudio for the testing the potential for the use of VR within our practice.\n\nVR is not the newest nor most innovative technology. Having been around for over 60 years since the first prototype [1], it has had considerable time to evolve.  So why has it just recently come into the spotlight?  Speculation as to whether VR would become mainstream was confirmed two years ago when Facebook purchased Oculus Rift, connecting the VR technology to 1.65 billion online users [2].  Recently, Sony made another stride towards mainstreaming VR when they announced their PlayStation VR headset, focused on gamers. This announcement revolutionised the market and created an affordable approach to VR, allowing users to utilise virtual reality without the need for expensive PC hardware. The PlayStation VR headset is already being used in 40 million households. VR is no longer just a niche product for a niche marketplace.",
			"What do we do with VR?\nNow that VR is accessible, what do we do with it? Although VR has been around in theory since the 1950\u2019s, it was not until the 1980\u2019s \u2013 before even the advent of the internet \u2013 that VR was being researched for practical applications, such as medical uses. Today, possible applications for VR seem endless, with various industries such as the military, fashion and entertainment industries embracing VR for a multitude of reasons. Whether the technology is being used to remotely defuse a bomb, help NASA refit satellite units, or allow users to try on clothing in a virtual catalogue; VR has now entered mainstream consciousness. The cross-platform unifying factor of VR is its user-centric nature. VR allows users to feel more in control and creates a unique relationship between designers and end-users. This user experience is much like the IKEA effect, which describes the cognitive bias in which customers place a superfluous amount of value on products partially made by themselves \u2013 as appreciation and self-worth often outweigh the standard pre-made product. The most recent example of this relationship is the VR capable Rio Olympics, hosted by NBC. Together with Samsung, around 30 million viewers per night were able to access the Olympic Games in virtual reality, as long as the viewer owned a Samsung device. This type of usage sets the stage for marketing VR.\n\nThe Olympics are a staple in the sporting calendar, familiar to almost everyone worldwide. With VR, Samsung added a unique feature to a familiar experience, creating a more vivid memory for audiences utilising the new technology. VR is still relatively new to the average user. Marketing strategies are currently fixated on the newness of VR today, capitalising on users who are unfamiliar with the technology. However, this type of marketing can create a fleeting feeling and runs the risk that the technology may be considered merely a gimmick. We believe that over time, due to its accessibility and diverse applications, VR will prove to be a relevant tool for all, especially architects.\n_____________________________________________\n[1] \"History Of Virtual Reality.\" Virtual Reality Society. 2016.

		"description": "The cable car system for Gothenburg comprises one cable car line with four stations and six towers. It was one of a number of projects planned by the City of Gothenburg to mark its 400th anniversary in 2021. UNStudio won the competition to design the Gothenburg Cable Car System at the end of 2017. From that point on, through a series or intense workshops with the client, the public transit services operator, V\u00e4sttrafik, and the cable car manufacturer, UNStudio developed the schematic design for the four stations and six towers. \n\nFor the people and the City of Gothenburg, the cable car would provide an alternative form of public transport by way of aerial shortcuts. Travel times would be significantly reduced with minimum environmental impact, while an efficient and direct connection would be established between areas north of the river and the old city to the south. The 3km long Gothenburg cable car line starts at J\u00e4rntorget in the historic city on the south bank of the river, where it links to a bus and tram transfer node. It then crosses the river and continues to three further stations in the north of the city.\n\nApproaching this project, the goal that we set for ourselves became fourfold, centering on place making, urban integration, efficient mobility and sustainability. We approached these goals with a specific toolset: layout optimization, natural wayfinding and accessibility, combined with a specific branding strategy that could create a clearly identifiable system for the City of Gothenburg.",

			"Placemaking\nAs a public transportation system, an urban cable car should be designed based on layout functionality and efficient, accessible mobility. Beyond that, as a new type of visually distinct public transportation, a cable car system creates opportunities to make new \u2018places\u2019 within a city; places that strengthen a city's identity while being fully integrated into the urban fabric and public transport system.\n\nThe most visually apparent elements of the Cable Car system are its towers. As highly visible landmarks, they would define a new skyline for the city. It is from this great responsibility that we wanted to move beyond aesthetics and make a true referential bridge between the history of the harbour city and its future. As such, the towers are inspired (and reference) the steady motion of Gothenburg\u2019s famous shipyard cranes. Designed in a way that emulates the dynamism of the cranes, the ever-changing constellation between the towers bring a multi-faceted and unique experience from different vantage points in the city. To create a clearly identifiable and visually continuity across the system, we used a series of design principles based on triangulation, adaptability, materiality, geometrical layering, transparency and nighttime illumination.\n\nIllumination was also key in the placemaking strategy, achieved by spotlights that line the inside of the tower beam surface. Light cutting through a gap between structural components creates a thin, sharp line which subtly emphasises the silhouette at night, visible across the city. This strong identity would make them clearly recognisable as destination points within the city, with the highest tower at the Lindholmen quay imagined as a city balcony located on the water: a new urban focal point that makes the water accessible and provides a new destination for social gathering. The stations themselves are not only designed around principles of natural wayfinding and social safety, but also with a strong identity in mind. Although each of the four stations would be unique, they would still be clearly recognisable as part of the same system, and also as destination points within the city.",
			"Urban Integration\nStations and towers need to adapt and adjust to varying programmatic and urban requirements in a way that meets the cable car operational and functional requirements while also allowing for necessary traffic clearances.\n\nThe towers are designed to be as light and transparent as possible, allowing views to the city through them. At the same time, their triangular geometry allows them to adapt and blend seamlessly into the various urban conditions. Their light and open structure avoids casting heavy shadows, while their base facilitating urban paths, streets and green spaces to pass through them, avoiding the creation of dark, socially unsafe conditions. \n\nA similar principle applies to the stations, which in their basic geometry, are designed to be adaptable to different urban conditions. Both the station shelters and the main circulation can be easily adjusted in a systematic way, making it possible for them to blend into their surroundings while remaining recognizable as Cable Car stations. At ground floor level, the permeability of the station design allows for an easy overview of both the station and surroundings, and unobstructed flows around and through the station\u2019s structure. The station thus becomes an almost seamless part of the urban landscape.",
			"Efficient Mobility\nThe design of the four stations along the cable car track create an efficient and accessible form of public transport that does not compromise on safety or natural wayfinding. As such, the basic geometry of the stations go beyond the single objective of adapting to different urban conditions. Public transport, being public by nature, needs to accommodate all types of travellers in an inclusive way. Everyone should be able to easily and comfortably navigate their way through the system. The triangulated wood clad walls and ceilings of the stations bring a warm glow and act as a strong, welcoming signifier. The gesture of the unfolded wood clad walls and ceilings guide passengers up towards the platform, where the 'floating' roof structure frames views of the surrounding city. Within the self-supporting roof structure, large skylights flood the platform with daylight, while all vertical transportation routes are carefully positioned to allow for the shortest routes and different speeds of travel. For the intermediate stations, a conceptual hinging mechanism around the station\u2019s \u2018centre point\u2019 enables their main geometry to \u2018kink\u2019 in different required directions.",
			"Sustainability\nA key element of the project is sustainability: environmental, social and economic. The Cable Car as a new type of urban public transportation is fundamentally pursued because of its benefits in terms of environmental impact. Energy use is reduced within the stations through the incorporation of large skylights that flood daylight into the stations and through the use of artificial lighting that uses low energy systems. Furthermore the energy for these systems would be provided by photovoltaic panels which are integrated into the roof surface of all stations. The design and engineering, in particular of the towers, is optimised towards prefabrication. This leads to shorter construction time of the cable car line on site and would therefore greatly minimise environmental impacts.\nFor the system to be fully sustainable however, it also needs to achieve social and economic sustainability, which can be facilitated by making the stations as accessible, as safe, and as user friendly as possible. This holistic approach to sustainability can be achieved through active and passive strategies that allow us to go beyond being environmentally conscious alone. Non-technological and passive approaches encompass material selection, public programming, accessibility and flexibility. These passive strategies are balanced by active technological approaches that optimise operational efficiency. In addition, the Gothenburg Cable Car system would increase the social value of publicly used buildings along its route, which in turn, would boost its own occupancy and use."

In its location, it has the potential and position to become a new \"center of the city\" for arts, culture, accommodation, entertainment, hospitality and wellness. Our vision is to reconnect this key urban precinct to the nearby Yarra river and Docklands, and to restore the historically vibrant Market Quarter feel. Facing Collins Street, William Street and Market Street, the site is flanked by public space corridors, allowing easy access to the nearby waterway.\n\nFor this project, we imagined a scheme that could push height restriction boundaries, allowing a better alternative to the typical building program and massing allocation. Our design allow this spot to become one of the most distinctive silhouettes on the Melbourne city skyline.\n\nSoaring 286 meters, well above other buildings along this section of Collins Street, the footprint of our design rotates as it rises, minimizing the shadow on Southbank and giving the building the appearance that it twists towards the sky. Extending the building vertically allows for a better alternative to the typical building program and massing allocation. Apartments can be positioned at the top of the tower, providing premium accommodation with wide urban, city and bay views. This repositioning of programs presents more opportunities for hotel and retail development at ground level. Culturally, this alternate massing allows for enhanced public realm features such as an amphitheater on Market Street and a space for cultural events under a welcoming lawn area.",

As such, the Art Gallery and Art Communication with artist residencies are housed in close proximity to one another. The Art Education Centre, Experimental Art Centre and Auction Centre however are kept as distinctly separate entities.\n\nEach volume is organised around a central void in order to guarantee flexibility for daily operations and future requirements. A common roof - resembling a composition of five brush strokes - unites the volumes, gives a clear address to the building and symbolises the shared spirit of the various centres.\n\nPlacing the building volumes in an almost radial manner enables the clear definition of a central space in the centre of the development. The flow of visitors is naturally led into this central plaza which acts as a large urban foyer connecting to the lobbies of all centres. This plaza is conceived as a spacious and bright zone, allowing for a variety of activities year round, from special exhibitions to art fairs to performances.",

		"description": "During the 2020 World Expo, many visitors will be introduced to Dubai for the first time, from young families to the big names of the future. It\u2019s this first impression of vibrancy and cultural distinction that became our foundational approach to the STAR 2020 project: a mixed-use campus gateway with exhibition space, retail opportunity and a residential master plan.\nRather than only designing for an enclosed indoor space, a key focus in our approach to the STAR 2020 project was to rethink how Dubai is experienced year round in a mixed in and out-door campus setting. Dubai\u2019s climate must be grappled with when deliberating the year round occupation of exterior spaces, and to overcome this, we managed to leverage many natural and passive sustainable methods within the design to bring greater comfort to visitors. Massing optimization was used to achieve increased shadow coverage, glazing orientation angled to reduce direct incident heat gain, natural climate cooling through pools and vegetation, and indigenous high R-value ceramics as shading louvers and surfaces on facades.\nCoiling through the site is a dual corridor of retail, forming themed \u201coasis plazas\u201d. In order to provide thermal protection and improve comfort to visitors during their shopping and leisure experience, we oriented the taller hospitality massing components on their sides on top of the retail blocks, thus utilizing their shading capability over longer portions of the site. The result is a stacking logic that creates countless shopping experiences and paths for discovery, keeping the visitor intrigued each time they visit the campus.",

While designed as autonomous objects the chairs can also be placed side by side as a family of forms in varying configurations.\nEasy to swivel and designed to enable communication, the Side Chair turns with ease to face other users. We designed two versions of this rounded chair: one with a left armrest and the other with a right armrest. As a variation on the Side Chair, the Tub Chair swivels just as easily, and has a more orthogonal form and armrests on both sides.\nDesigned to enable privacy during communication, the curved high back of the Silent Chair envelops the user, creating a sense of retreat and concealment. Available in two sizes the Poufs can be casually clustered for brainstorming in teams or easily moved to join other configurations of the Seating Stones family.",

By creating alternatives to aluminum coating systems used in the building industry, the amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be reduced, leading to improved indoor air quality.\n\nIndoor air quality and emissions from building materials have been a major challenge for both the industry and consumers over the last few decades. Traditional construction materials contribute to contaminants such as VOCs, formaldehyde, particulates and fibres.\n\nHowever, new circular and planet-centric building materials are able to provide a healthier indoor environment, both by substituting a source of contamination and by eliminating contaminants that arise from other indoor sources.\n\nThe goal of the project is to design biocomposited materials that lead to the creation of three products: an interior partition system, a multi-layered facade system and a curtain wall facade system. In this process the consortium is researching photocatalytic coatings, biocomposites foams for insulation and thermoset biocomposites for structural profiles."

		"description": "The new 125,000 m\u00b2 development for Changi airport in Singapore is located at the heart of the airport complex and serves to connect the airport\u2019s ensemble of terminals and existing structures. UNStudio\u2019s design proposal for the new complex offered a blend of nature and mall, with unique attractions that additionally provide an attractive destination for the residents of Singapore.\n\nThe new structure accommodates food & beverage areas, garden activities, retail areas, lounges and a cineplex and movie themed attraction. The three main components, Attraction, Aviation and Retail, are merged to form one programme and are weaved together throughout the building.\n\nThe garden attraction forms the main thread within the design and is a theme of all the activities in the building. The varied hexagonal units in the double-layered facade control daylight penetration and views while maximising shading in the areas where this is required. UNStudio's design for the new complex presents a high-performance building targeting low consumption energy levels and high standards of comfort.",

		"description": "In 2012 UNStudio was invited by the Hyundai Development Company to break the mega block mold: a design intervention that would counteract the prevailing ultra-standardised approach to Korean apartment living. We were asked to create a series of distinct identities across multiple scales for two residential developments in Daegu Wolbae. The results are provocative, investigative, affordable and health-focused facades and parklands that establish new and healthy lifestyles and break away from the impersonal tradition of high-density living.",

			"Apartment Living\nWhen the Hyundai Development Company asked UNStudio to assist in creating the IPark apartment developments, we opted for a \u2018people first\u2019 approach. The residents of this new development now enjoy shared amenities that encourage a sense of community and promote physical and psychological wellbeing. While other buildings leave no option but to return home, residents of the IPark have healthy options: to use the fitness spaces, enjoy the playgrounds with their children, or engage with nature by strolling through the landscaped courtyards and meeting with neighbours.",
			"Textile City\nDaegu is the fourth largest city in South Korea and is often referred to as \u2018Textile City\u2019 - due to its rich history of manufacturing textiles and its annual fashion and textile fairs. By contrast, the repetitive colour and silhouettes of the city\u2019s dominating mega-blocks do not reflect the Daegu identity. In order to capture the essence of this city's vibrant character, two multi-coloured, pixelated motifs - similar in part to the texture of fabric, or a media screen - are used to weave the apartment towers together, whilst creating distinct identities for each development. This use of colour zoning not only reinforces identity, it also establishes community and communicates the relationship between the inside and outside of the two mega-blocks.",
			"Family Friendly High-Rise\nWhen green space is found next to high-rise neighbourhoods, it immediately becomes a recreational opportunity for local inhabitants, so long as they are close by and easily accessible. While balconies can also bring nature into the living space, they can quickly become cramped, cluttered, underused, or sit uneasily with younger families who live on higher stories.\nBy placing green parkland at the focal point of the IPark residential blocks, we not only allow for recreation, but encourage a healthy lifestyle and community development for those who live within the blocks themselves. These large open park spaces allow for whole families - who may otherwise not have an opportunity to meet - to gather together in a safe, natural environment. For young families, this space is an opportunity for childhood friendships to develop in the playgrounds, while young adults and teenagers can find a direct link to nature along the running track and gravel forest trails. Such green cores encourage community spirit and can act as a buffer to the social seclusion sometimes found in less considered high rise residential blocks."

		"description": "For retail block of the W21-22 plot, the second of our five Baku White City Developments, we designed a self-standing urban actor that is equally rooted in Baku\u2019s cultural identity as it is in the city\u2019s urban fabric. Similar to Baku\u2019s archetypical buildings, such as the Caravanserai or the Bazar, we wanted to show the arch as a persevering architectural leitmotif. Baku\u2019s geographical identity as the City of Wind adds more layers to the concept design of the building. Like a rock that is carved over years by the wind, the volume of the building looks as though it were shaped into a prismatic and reflecting surface: an urban kaleidoscope. With a special ceramic cladding, the materialization of the fa\u00e7ade speaks a clear modern language with reference to local archetypes. The development of this fa\u00e7ade played a pivotal role in shifting our design thinking, as it was the first building we developed to be covered in a ceramic cladding.\n\nThe building site is embedded geographically in the infrastructural network of Baku\u2019s White City, as it sits on one of Baku\u2019s most important traffic routes. The urban flow that connects the historical Old City with the new White City is situated next to the commercial heart of the new development. The retail potential of the ground floor responds to the opportune location of the building within the urban fabric. Anchor retailers can make use of the northern facades that are exposed to the main road that have optimal visibility. The reflective cantilever at Nobel Avenue attracts attention from the pedestrian boulevard along this important traffic artery, and gives the building a defined orientation. The pace of the West side and the South street, which are calmer and more pedestrian friendly, resonant with the western and southern interiors of the block, encouraging a slow window shopping atmosphere.\n\nA working landscape of natural daylight and fa\u00e7ade ventilation on the top floor of the building create an excellent professional atmosphere on the upper floors, with floor plans that allow for a high level of flexibility. Furthermore, a sustainable heating and cooling system in the form of a soil collector can be located in the building\u2019s base, with boreholes depths of 100 to 200 meters. The collector would fulfill the dual function of heat source in the winter, and heat sink in the summer.",

		"description": "Hanjie Wanda Square is a luxury shopping plaza which houses international brand stores, world-class boutiques, catering outlets and cinemas. Our approach to the design of the Hanjie Wanda Square combines both contemporary and traditional design elements in one concept.\n\nThe concept of synergy of flows is key to all of the design components; the fluid articulation of the building envelope, the programming of the dynamic fa\u00e7ade lighting and its content design and the interior pattern language which guides customers from the central atria to the upper levels and throughout the building via linking corridors. The interior concept is developed around the North and South atria, creating two different, yet integrated atmospheres. Variations in geometry, materials and details define these differing characters. The North atrium is characterized by warm golden and bronze materials reflecting a cultural, traditional identity. In the South atrium silver and grey nuances with reflective textures reflect the city identity and its urban rhythm. Both atria are crowned by skylights with a funnel structure which connect the roof and the ground floor, in addition to integrating the panorama lifts.\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade design focuses on achieving a dynamic effect reflecting the handcrafted combination of two materials: polished stainless steel and patterned glass. These two materials are crafted into nine differently shaped, but standardized spheres. Their specific positions in relation to each other recreate the effect of movement and reflection in water, or the sensuous folds of silk fabric.",

		"description": "Located in the heart of HafenCity, the largest ongoing urban regeneration program in Europe, is the \u00dcberseequartier, an up-and-coming lively district along the banks of the River Elbe. Here, UNStudio has designed two towers - called Luv&Lee - situated at the end of the \u00dcberseeboulevard, which connects the harbour with the city centre. When viewed from the river, the two towers act as a landmark and frame one of the waterside entrances to the \u00dcberseequartier and the city.\n\nThe arrangement of Luv&Lee and the underlying podium continues the block structure of the Southern \u00dcberseequartier. In this way the tower ensemble guides sight lines, ensures the rhythmic continuation of the boulevard and opens up views to the waterfront.\n\nThe urban scale of the surroundings is reflected in the dimensions of the towers which, by adding rhythm to the staggered positioning of the wharf, demarcate a \u2018gateway\u2019 at the end of the boulevard. The urban context of the Southern \u00dcberseequartier is referred to by the 360-degree facades of the two towers with entrances and lobbies to the east and west, retail to the north and on-grade and elevated outdoor terraces to the south. Both day and evening activation takes place in the podium programme, with caf\u00e9s and restaurants, signaling and promoting urban vitality.",

The exteriors of the two volumes are illuminated by art projections, creating a vast media facade as a contemporary translation of the ancient stone drum inscriptions.\n\nWhilst the architecture of the museum is represented by the ancient artifact of the stone drum, the art within represents its spirit, or its \u201cessence\u201d. In the same way that the agile strokes of ink in a Chinese painting give spirit to a blank piece of paper, the art collection gives spirit to the museum.\n\nThe main focus of the design is to create optimal and varied spaces for the display of art; Spaces of different character, but all offering extensive lighting possibilities and ample wall space in order to provide artists and curators with the optimal conditions in which to display their work and communicate their ideas. The design further incorporates high levels of circulation space, with the internal organisation divided into different routes, each guiding the varying visitor groups around themed sequences of art and additional programmes. \n\nThe NAMOC is strongly embedded within its cultural and urban context. The public urban plinth plateaus of the cultural district act as 24/7 connectors and attractors between the levels of the street, the underground, and the museum volumes.\n\n ",

The principle design intention was to curate the visitor experience by elaborating on an implicit circulation strategy. The route of the visitor, from the approach to the building and throughout the tour within, is treated as an ongoing exhibition. The building is therefore configured as a clear illustration of this strategy, which becomes the central feature both within the interior space, and as a generator of the fa\u00e7ade design. The resultant crossing over of the circulation ribbon produces various viewpoints of the exhibited content, in this case, the facades of the show-units.",

The atrium plays an important role in the station's identity. At the heart of the station a direct connection is introduced, allowing the users to use the retail facilities while waiting for their departure. The escalators organize the concourse while the bridge at the centre of the atrium links different points of the retail level. The large structure of the roof mirrors the geometry of the bridge below, allowing for a column free space.",

Leaf-shaped openings in the facade give the building a strong identity with landmark potential. The building follows the structure of a (grand) house: with three levels, each spanning a varying number of split-level floors and each with its own atmosphere and purpose. Each floor is in principle divided into four leaves, which are set in a spiral pattern.

Through the vertical void customers have clear sight lines, with views of the shop facades and activities around this public void.

		"description": "The electricity station is Amersfoort is an almost entirely sealed container for three electrical transformers (50/10 kV). The polar division into two interlocking volumes is paralleled by the difference in claddings. The spatial encounters of the facade planes, through this polarity, which at times embraces a contextual dimension, refer to the invisible transformation process of electrical currents. The insulating basalt lava and the conductive aluminium present a contrast deepened by vertical and horizontal articulation. Employing light aluminium on the south facade and darker basalt lava on the north explicates the spatial context.",
